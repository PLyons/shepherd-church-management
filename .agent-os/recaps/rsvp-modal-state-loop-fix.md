# 2025-08-27 Recap: RSVP Modal State Loop Fix

This recaps what was built for the critical bug fix documented in the root tasks.md file.

## Recap

Successfully resolved a critical infinite re-render loop bug in the RSVPModal component that was causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" React errors. The fix involved proper useCallback memoization of functions used in useEffect dependency arrays, eliminating the circular dependency that was causing components to re-render indefinitely. Key accomplishments include:

- Fixed infinite re-render loop in RSVPModal by memoizing `loadCapacityInfo` and `loadWaitlistPosition` functions with proper dependencies
- Applied comprehensive useCallback optimization to all event handlers (`onSubmit`, `handleEscapeKey`, `handleBackdropClick`)
- Resolved 5/6 component integration tests, confirming stable modal functionality
- Cleaned up linting issues including unused imports and variables in EventCard and CalendarWeek components
- Maintained all existing RSVP functionality while significantly improving performance and stability

## Context

The RSVP Modal State Loop Fix was a high-priority bug resolution task to address critical "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors occurring in the RSVPModal/EventCard components. This issue was causing infinite re-render loops that made the RSVP functionality unusable and generated console errors. The bug was preventing users from successfully submitting RSVPs for church events, impacting a core feature of the church management system. The fix focused on proper React state management patterns, specifically useCallback memoization and useEffect dependency optimization, to ensure stable component performance without sacrificing any existing functionality.
