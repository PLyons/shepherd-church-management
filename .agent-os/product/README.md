## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **No `any` types** - Strict TypeScript usage throughout
- **Functional components** with React hooks
- **Async/await** syntax over promises
- **Service layer** for all Firebase operations
- **Type-safe converters** for Firestore data transformation

### Security Requirements
- **Role-based access** enforced at service and component levels
- **Firebase Security Rules** for database-level security
- **Member data privacy** - members only see own data
- **Pastor access** for pastoral care without financial data
- **Admin access** for system administration

### MCP Server Integration
- **Context7**: React/TypeScript coding standards and documentation
- **Semgrep**: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- **Serena**: Intelligent code search and analysis
- **Firebase MCP**: Database operations and security rule management
- **GitHub MCP**: PR creation and issue management

## Development Workflow

### Phase-Based Development
Development follows PRP (Purpose-Requirements-Procedure) task format:
- **Purpose**: Clear objective and business value
- **Requirements**: Dependencies and success criteria
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step implementation guide

### Current Phase Priority
1. **Complete Phase 2B** - Finish RSVP Modal and Attendance Tracking (2-3 weeks)
2. **Phase 2C** - Donation Tracking implementation (3-4 weeks)
3. **Phase 2D** - Volunteer Scheduling system (2-3 weeks)
4. **Phase 2E** - Sermon Archive functionality (2-3 weeks)

### Quality Assurance
- **Manual testing guides** for each major feature
- **Data verification protocols** for Firestore operations
- **Role-based testing** across Admin/Pastor/Member permissions
- **Security scanning** with Semgrep before commits

## Agent OS Integration Opportunities

### High-Value Automation Areas
1. **Member Data Quality**: Duplicate detection, profile completion, data validation
2. **Event Management**: Recurring events, reminder automation, waitlist processing
3. **Financial Compliance**: Donation categorization, tax reporting, audit trails
4. **Pastoral Care**: Follow-up scheduling, communication tracking, care analytics

### Agent-Ready Infrastructure
