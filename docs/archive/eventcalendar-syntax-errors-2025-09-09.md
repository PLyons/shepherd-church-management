# EventCalendar.tsx Critical Syntax Errors Preventing Development Server

**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED (2025-09-09)  
**Component**: `src/components/events/EventCalendar.tsx`  
**Impact**: Development server cannot compile, application inaccessible

**ðŸŽ‰ RESOLUTION**: All syntax errors have been resolved. The EventCalendar component is now fully operational with working calendar views, event interaction, and RSVP integration. Development server is running successfully.

## Summary

The EventCalendar.tsx file contains multiple critical syntax errors that prevent Vite from compiling the application. The development server starts but crashes with compilation errors, making the entire application inaccessible.

## Root Cause Analysis

The file appears to have been corrupted during previous editing sessions, resulting in:

1. **Duplicate export declarations**
2. **Orphaned JSX closing tags** 
3. **Incorrect import paths**
4. **Malformed JSX structure**

## Specific Errors

### 1. Duplicate Export Declaration
**Location**: Line 31  
**Error**: `export const export const EventCalendar: React.FC<EventCalendarProps> = ({`  
**Fix Required**: Remove duplicate `export const`  

```typescript
// Current (broken)
export const export const EventCalendar: React.FC<EventCalendarProps> = ({

// Should be
export const EventCalendar: React.FC<EventCalendarProps> = ({
```

### 2. Orphaned JSX Closing Tags
**Location**: Lines 321-323  
**Error**: Orphaned `))}` and `</div>` tags without matching opening structures  

```typescript
// Current (broken)
  );
};
          ))}  // <- Orphaned closing tags
        </div>  // <- Orphaned closing tag
      </div>
    );
```

### 3. Invalid Import Path
**Location**: Line 21 (estimated)  
**Error**: `import { rsvpService } from "../../services/firebase/rsvp.service";`  
**Fix Required**: Correct import path to match actual service file  

```typescript
// Current (broken)
import { rsvpService } from "../../services/firebase/rsvp.service";

// Should be
import { eventRSVPService } from "../../services/firebase/event-rsvp.service";
```

## Vite Compilation Errors

The following errors appear in the development server output:

```
Internal server error: Unexpected keyword 'export'. (31:13)
Internal server error: Unexpected token (321:10)
Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "../../services/firebase/rsvp.service"
```

## Impact Assessment

- **Development**: Cannot run development server
- **Testing**: Cannot test calendar functionality  
- **Deployment**: Cannot build application
- **Team Productivity**: Blocks all calendar-related development

## Current Workaround

None available. The syntax errors must be fixed before development can continue.

## Recommended Fix Strategy

1. **Backup Current File**: Save current state for reference
2. **Use Working Version**: Reference a known working version of EventCalendar.tsx from git history
3. **Systematic Repair**: Fix syntax errors in order of severity:
   - Fix duplicate export declaration
   - Correct import paths  
   - Repair JSX structure
   - Validate all opening/closing tag pairs

## Files Affected

- `src/components/events/EventCalendar.tsx` (primary)
- Development server compilation (secondary)
- Any components importing EventCalendar (secondary)

## Environment Details

- **Vite Version**: 5.4.19
- **Node.js**: Latest stable
- **Development Server Ports Attempted**: 5173, 5174, 5175
- **Error Plugin**: vite:react-babel

## Additional Context

This issue emerged during a session focused on fixing event data consistency between calendar and events list views. The dashboard service fix was successfully completed, but the EventCalendar.tsx file corruption is preventing verification of the full fix.

## Next Steps

1. Fix EventCalendar.tsx syntax errors
2. Restart development server
3. Verify dashboard service fix works end-to-end
4. Test calendar, events list, and dashboard synchronization

## Related Issues

- Event data consistency fix (completed but unverified due to this issue)
- Dashboard service displaying upcoming events (fixed, pending verification)
