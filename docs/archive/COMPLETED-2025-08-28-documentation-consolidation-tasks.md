# Documentation Consolidation Tasks

> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Ready for Implementation
> Priority: High - Critical for project clarity

## Task 1: Create Single Source of Truth Document
- [ ] 1.1 Create docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md with current accurate status
- [ ] 1.2 Include MVP completion at ~85% (5.1 of 6 components)
- [ ] 1.3 Document Firebase index bug as critical outstanding issue
- [ ] 1.4 Add development commands and key references sections
- [ ] 1.5 Include correct development timeline (08-16 to 08-28)
- [ ] 1.6 Verify all percentages and dates are accurate

## Task 2: Fix Date Errors Across Documentation
- [ ] 2.1 Update docs/project_tracker.md dates from 01-16 to 08-16
- [ ] 2.2 Update docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md date from 01-16 to 08-16
- [ ] 2.3 Search for any other instances of 01-16 date pattern
- [ ] 2.4 Update all found dates to correct 08-16 format

## Task 3: Update Primary Documentation References
- [ ] 3.1 Update CLAUDE.md Project Status section to reference PROJECT_STATUS.md
- [ ] 3.2 Update docs/INDEX.md to feature PROJECT_STATUS.md prominently
- [ ] 3.3 Update .agent-os/product/roadmap.md to align with 85% Phase 2B completion
- [ ] 3.4 Verify all cross-references are consistent

## Task 4: Organize Bug Documentation
- [ ] 4.1 Add [PENDING] status to rsvp-modal-firebase-index-error.md header
- [ ] 4.2 Add [FIXED] status to completed bug fixes
- [ ] 4.3 Create bug status summary in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- [ ] 4.4 Ensure Firebase index bug is marked as critical priority

## Task 5: Archive Outdated Documentation
- [ ] 5.1 Move tasks.md to docs/archive/ with [COMPLETED] prefix
- [ ] 5.2 Archive docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md as outdated
- [ ] 5.3 Archive docs/current-features.md as superseded
- [ ] 5.4 Update docs/archive/ARCHIVE_README.md with new entries

## Execution Guidelines

### Order of Execution
Execute tasks in numerical order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) to maintain consistency and avoid broken references.

### Quality Checks
- Verify all dates use 08-16 to 08-28 timeline
- Ensure MVP completion is consistently reported as 85%
- Confirm Firebase index bug is prominently documented as critical
- Check that all cross-references resolve correctly

### Success Criteria
- Single authoritative PROJECT_STATUS.md exists
- All date inconsistencies resolved
- Primary docs reference new status document
- Bug documentation is properly organized
- Outdated files are archived with proper metadata

## Notes
- This consolidation addresses fragmented project status across multiple files
- Focus is on accuracy and single source of truth for current project state
- Archive approach preserves historical context while reducing confusion
