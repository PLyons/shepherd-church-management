- **Toast notification system** - Success and error feedback integrated
- **Git workflow completion** - Branch creation, commits, and merge to main branch

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created
- `src/components/events/EventForm.tsx` - 436-line comprehensive form component
- `src/pages/CreateEvent.tsx` - Role-protected event creation page
- `src/pages/EditEvent.tsx` - Role-protected event editing page  
- `src/utils/event-validation.ts` - Date and capacity validation utilities

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Form Sections**: Basic Information, Date & Time, Visibility & Access, Capacity Management
2. **Smart Date Inputs**: Conditional rendering based on all-day checkbox state
3. **Event Type Support**: Complete dropdown with all 13 EventType categories
4. **Capacity Controls**: Optional capacity with conditional waitlist enablement
5. **Professional Styling**: Consistent with Shepherd's TailwindCSS design patterns
6. **Loading States**: Proper UX during form submission and event loading
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display and toast notifications

### Validation Rules Implemented
- Event title (required, 3+ characters)
- Event type selection (required from enum)
- Location (required)
- Start/end date validation (required, future dates, logical order)
- Capacity validation (positive numbers only)
- Date format handling (ISO format conversion)

## Test Results

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Event creation workflow end-to-end
- ✅ Event editing with pre-populated data
- ✅ All-day event toggle functionality
- ✅ Date/time validation edge cases
- ✅ Capacity and waitlist conditional display
- ✅ Role-based access restrictions (admin/pastor only)
- ✅ Form validation messages display correctly
- ✅ Loading states during submission
- ✅ Navigation cancel/success flows
- ✅ Toast notification integration

### Edge Cases Validated
- Empty required fields trigger validation
- Past dates properly rejected
- End date before start date handled
- Negative capacity values rejected
- Long event titles and descriptions handled
- All event types selectable and functional

## Integration Status

### Service Layer Integration ✅
- EventsService.create() and update() methods working
- Form data properly converted to Event interface
- Error handling for service layer failures

### Authentication Integration ✅
- RequireRole component properly restricting access
- User context available for event creation
- Role validation working at page level

### Navigation Integration ✅
- Router integration with useNavigate
- Parameter handling for event editing
- Proper redirect flows on success/cancel

### Toast System Integration ✅
- Success messages on event creation/update
- Error messages for failures
- Consistent with existing patterns

## Impact on MVP Progress

### Phase 2B Event System Progress
- **Before PRP-2B-005**: 60% complete (data layer and basic UI)
- **After PRP-2B-005**: 75% complete (full event creation/editing capability)
- **Remaining**: Event List/Cards, Calendar View, RSVP Modal system

### Overall MVP Impact
- **Core Event CRUD**: Now 100% functional for admin/pastor users
- **Event Management Workflow**: Complete creation and editing interface
- **Foundation for UI Components**: Event forms ready for integration with list/calendar views

## Next Logical Steps

### Immediate Priority (PRP-2B-006)
- **Event List & Cards Component** - Display events with filtering and search
- **Event discovery interface** - Member-facing event browsing
- **Integration with EventForm** - Edit buttons and navigation flows

### Dependencies Created
- EventForm component available for reuse in modal contexts
- Event creation/editing patterns established for consistency
- Validation utilities ready for other event components

## Quality Metrics Achieved
