**Last Updated:** 2025-08-20

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0.1 Enhanced Member Forms (2025-08-20) ✅
- ✅ **Enhanced TypeScript Types** - Professional contact arrays with type safety
  - Added emails[], phones[], addresses[] arrays to Member interface
  - Maintained backward compatibility with deprecated email/phone fields
  - Proper typing for MemberFormData with array support
  
- ✅ **Deep Field Mapping** - Enhanced camelCase ↔ snake_case conversion
  - Added toFirestoreFieldsDeep() and fromFirestoreFieldsDeep() functions
  - Recursive conversion for nested array structures
  - Proper handling of complex nested data (smsOptIn → sms_opt_in, etc.)
  
- ✅ **MemberFormEnhanced Component** - Complete professional form implementation
  - Collapsible sections (Basic, Contact, Addresses, Administrative)
  - Dynamic field arrays with add/remove functionality
  - Conditional SMS opt-in for mobile phone types
  - Migration logic for old data format
  - Comprehensive form validation
  
- ✅ **Enhanced Services** - Deep field mapping integration
  - Updated members.service.ts with toFirestoreFieldsDeep()
  - Proper data transformation for create/update operations
  - Maintained data integrity and type safety
  
- ✅ **Enhanced Member List** - Primary contact display
  - getPrimaryEmail() and getPrimaryPhone() helper functions
  - Smart fallback logic (arrays → primary → deprecated → 'N/A')
  - Added phone column to member directory table
  
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing Documentation**
  - Created MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md with 5-phase testing protocol
  - Created FIRESTORE-DATA-VERIFICATION.md with data format verification
  - Detailed testing procedures and success criteria

### Code Quality Improvements (2025-01-16)
- ✅ **ESLint Issues Resolution** - 39% reduction in linting issues
  - Fixed React hooks rule violations (critical for functionality)
  - Converted all TypeScript `any` types to proper types
  - Removed unused imports and variables across components and services
  - Fixed conditional hook calls that violated React rules
  - **Progress:** 79 issues → 48 issues (39% improvement)

## Current Status & Next Steps

### Phase 0.1 Status: COMPLETE ✅
- **Achievement:** Professional contact management system fully implemented
- **Status:** All components working together, TypeScript errors reduced from 14 to 11
- **Ready for:** Manual testing and Phase 0.2+ implementation

### Next Priority: Phase 0.2+ (Per PRD)
- **Status:** Foundation ready for next phase implementation
- **Options:**
  1. Continue with PRD Phase sequence (Event Management, etc.)
  2. Complete remaining code quality cleanup (11 TypeScript errors)
  3. Manual testing and validation of Phase 0.1 implementation

### Technical Debt
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Items:**
  - Refactor context files for better fast refresh support
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Add comprehensive TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Progress Metrics
