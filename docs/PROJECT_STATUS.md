## 🏗️ Development Methodology

### TDD as Primary Development Standard
**MANDATORY:** All new development must follow established TDD practices as demonstrated in Phase 2C foundation layers.

#### Test-First Implementation Requirements
- **PRP-2C-005 onwards:** Must implement comprehensive test suites BEFORE production code
- **Coverage Targets:** 80% minimum, 95%+ preferred (as achieved in foundation)
- **Security Testing:** Firebase emulator integration required for all financial components
- **Quality Gates:** All tests must pass before feature acceptance

#### Primary Development Interface
- **Agent Workflow:** Use `agents.md` as primary interface for specialized development tasks
- **Technical Standards:** Reference `CLAUDE.md` for architecture patterns and coding standards
- **Task Specifications:** Follow PRP documentation in `docs/prps/phase-2c-donations/` for requirements

#### Development Process
1. **Read PRP Specifications:** Understand requirements from task documentation
2. **Write Failing Tests:** Implement comprehensive test cases first (RED)
3. **Implement Features:** Develop minimum code to pass tests (GREEN)
4. **Refactor & Optimize:** Improve code quality while maintaining tests (REFACTOR)
5. **Validate Coverage:** Ensure 80%+ test coverage before completion

## 🐛 Recently Fixed Issues

### [FIXED] Empty Donation Categories Dropdown - Functionality Restored (2025-09-22)
- **Issue:** Donation category dropdown was empty and not displaying any options
- **Impact:** Users could not record donations due to missing category selection options
- **Root Cause:** Missing `donation-categories` collection in Firestore database, service method lacked proper sorting
- **Solution:**
  - Created 8 default donation categories via Firebase Console with proper field structure
  - Fixed `getActiveCategories()` method to sort by `displayOrder` using client-side sorting
  - Avoided Firestore composite index requirement by using JavaScript sort instead of database ordering
- **Categories Added:** General Fund, Missions, Building Fund, Youth Ministry, Children's Ministry, Music Ministry, Benevolence Fund, Special Events
- **Testing:** Verified categories load in correct order (1-8) and donation form is fully functional
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - All donation form functionality restored and operational

### [FIXED] Firebase Index Error - RSVP Functionality Restored (2025-09-08)
- **Issue:** RSVP submissions failed with "query requires index" error
- **Impact:** 100% of RSVP functionality was broken - users could not register for events
- **Root Cause:** Missing composite Firebase index for `rsvps` collection group queries
- **Solution:** Created composite index via Firebase Console: `rsvps` collection group with `status` (ASC) + `createdAt` (DESC)
- **Fix Method:** Firebase Console URL from error message → Create Index → Index deployed and enabled
- **Testing:** End-to-end RSVP workflow verified - users can now successfully register for events
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - All RSVP functionality restored and operational

- **Impact:** RSVP modal unusable, console errors preventing submissions
- **Fix:** Proper useCallback memoization of functions in useEffect dependencies
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - All RSVP modal functionality restored

### [FIXED] NaN Display Bug in EventCard (2025-08-27)
