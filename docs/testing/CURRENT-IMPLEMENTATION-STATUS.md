## ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED - DO NOT TEST

### 1. Donations Module
- **Status**: UI still uses Supabase, not connected to Firebase
- **Firebase service exists** but not integrated with UI
- **Skip all donation-related testing**

### 2. Sermons Module
- **Status**: Not implemented in Firebase
- **File upload disabled**
- **Skip all sermon-related testing**

### 3. Volunteers Module
- **Status**: UI still uses Supabase
- **No Firebase implementation**
- **Skip all volunteer-related testing**

### 4. Reports Module
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Limited functionality**

## üß™ TESTING PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Core Authentication (CRITICAL)
1. Test magic link login flow
2. Test password reset functionality
3. Verify role-based access control
4. Test session persistence and logout

### Phase 2: Member & Household Management (HIGH)
1. Test member directory and search
2. Verify member profile viewing/editing
3. Test household relationships
4. Verify role-based permissions

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Navigation (MEDIUM)
1. Verify dashboard statistics accuracy
2. Test role-based dashboard content
3. Check navigation permissions
4. Test responsive design

### Phase 4: Events (LOW - Due to Partial Implementation)
1. Test basic event display
2. Verify event creation (Admin/Pastor only)
3. Test public/private event visibility
4. Note any RSVP/attendance issues for future development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TESTERS

1. **Focus on implemented features only** - Skip donations, sermons, and volunteers
2. **Use test accounts provided** - Create new accounts via password reset
3. **Report issues clearly** - Specify which module and user role
4. **Performance may vary** - First load may be slower as Firebase initializes
5. **Some buttons/links may lead to unimplemented features** - This is expected

## üêõ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **RSVP System**: Basic functionality only, full implementation pending
2. **File Uploads**: Disabled for sermons, limited for other features
3. **Email Notifications**: May be limited or delayed
4. **Search Performance**: May be slower with larger datasets
5. **Mobile Experience**: Some features may have limited mobile optimization

## üìù WHEN REPORTING ISSUES

Include:
- **Module**: Which feature area (Auth, Members, Events, etc.)
- **User Role**: Which account you were using
- **Action**: What you were trying to do
- **Expected**: What should have happened
- **Actual**: What actually happened
- **Browser/Device**: Your testing environment

## üöÄ READY TO TEST?

Start with **Phase 1: Core Authentication** and work through the implemented features only. Remember, this is a beta test of a partially migrated system - your feedback on the working features is valuable for stabilizing the foundation before completing the remaining modules.
