## 🧪 Beta Testing Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Authentication & Members (Start Here)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **Test Registration Flow**
   - Visit the app → Click "Sign Up"
   - Use a real email address you can access
   - Check email for Firebase auth link
   - Complete registration and verify login

2. **Test Password Reset**
   - Use "Forgot Password" with test emails above
   - Verify email delivery and password reset flow
   - Test login with new password

3. **Test Member Directory**
   - Login as different roles (admin, pastor, member)
   - Verify member list displays correctly
   - Test search functionality
   - Verify role-based permissions

### Phase 2: Dashboard & Navigation
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Dashboard Statistics**
   - Verify member counts are accurate (should show 14 total, 14 active)
   - Check event counts (should show 3 upcoming events)
   - Test navigation between sections

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Login as different roles
   - Verify admins see all features
   - Verify members see limited features
   - Test permission boundaries

### Phase 3: Events & Data Integrity  
**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Event Display**
   - View events calendar/list
   - Verify test events appear correctly
   - Test event details display

2. **Data Relationships**
   - Verify members show correct households
   - Check that primary contacts are set correctly
   - Test data consistency

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Components Not Yet Updated
Some pages may show empty data or errors because they haven't been updated to Firebase yet:
- Events page may have mixed functionality
- Profile pages may need refresh after login
- Some forms may not work correctly

**Workaround**: Focus testing on Dashboard and Members pages which are fully migrated.

### Performance Notes
- First load may be slower as Firebase initializes
- Real-time updates should be instant once connected
- Large member lists load progressively

## 📝 Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, please include:

### Critical Information
- **User Role**: Which test account you were using
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Action**: What you were trying to do
- **Expected**: What should have happened
- **Actual**: What actually happened
- **Data Context**: Which members/households/events involved

### Example Issue Report
