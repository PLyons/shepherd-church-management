# Testing Tools Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains interactive tools and workflows designed to streamline the beta testing process for the Shepherd Church Management System. These tools bridge the gap between issue discovery and GitHub issue creation, ensuring consistent, complete, and properly formatted bug reports and feature requests.

## Available Tools

### 1. Issue Collection Workflow (`issue-collector.md`)
Interactive workflow for systematically collecting issue information from beta testers.

**Purpose**: Guide users through complete issue documentation
**Usage**: Say "I found a bug" or "I want to report an issue"
**Output**: Structured issue information ready for formatting

### 2. GitHub Issue Formatter (`github-issue-formatter.md`)
Automated formatting tool that converts collected issue information into GitHub-ready markdown.

**Purpose**: Format issues according to project templates
**Usage**: Processes collected information from issue collector
**Output**: GitHub-ready issue content with proper labels and formatting
