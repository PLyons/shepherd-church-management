## Module Coverage
### Modules Tested This Session
- ‚úÖ **Authentication & User Management** - Complete coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Member Management** - Partial coverage (search issues encountered)
- ‚ùå **Event Management** - Not tested (blocked by authentication issues)
- üìã **Dashboard** - Not tested (time constraints)

### Test Scenarios Completed
**Authentication Module:** 8/10 scenarios completed
**Member Module:** 5/10 scenarios completed
**Event Module:** 0/10 scenarios completed

## Performance Observations
### Page Load Times
| Page/Feature | Load Time | Acceptable (Y/N) | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Dashboard | 2.1 seconds | Y | Within target |
| Member Directory | 4.8 seconds | N | Slower than expected |
| Event Calendar | 1.9 seconds | Y | Fast loading |

### User Experience Notes
- Navigation between modules is intuitive
- Form validation messages are clear and helpful
- Mobile responsiveness works well on tested device
- Search functionality needs performance improvement

## Blockers and Impediments
1. **Authentication Token Issue** - Blocking QR registration testing
2. **Member Search Performance** - Significantly slowing member module testing
3. **Event Creation Access** - Unable to access event creation form (permission issue?)

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. Investigate and fix QR token validation issue (Priority: High)
2. Optimize member search performance (Priority: Medium)
3. Verify event creation permissions for test accounts

### Testing Strategy Adjustments
1. Focus on authentication fixes before proceeding with dependent modules
2. Allocate more time for member module testing due to performance issues
3. Prepare alternative test data for QR registration testing

## Next Session Planning
### Planned Focus Areas
1. Verify authentication fixes
2. Complete member management testing
3. Begin event management testing
4. Test donation module if time permits

### Required Preparations
1. Obtain updated QR tokens for testing
2. Prepare additional test data for member search testing
3. Verify event creation permissions
