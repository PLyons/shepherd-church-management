## Issue Workflow Process

### 1. Issue Creation by Beta Testers

**When to Create an Issue:**
- Bug discovered during testing
- Feature enhancement suggestion
- Documentation clarification needed
- Testing scenario unclear
- Performance issue encountered

**Issue Creation Steps:**
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Select appropriate issue template
3. Fill out all template sections completely
4. Add relevant labels (at minimum: severity, module, type)
5. Assign to appropriate milestone (current beta phase)
6. Submit issue

### 2. Issue Triage by Development Team

**Triage Timeline:** Within 24 hours for critical issues, 48 hours for others

**Triage Process:**
1. Review issue details for completeness
2. Reproduce issue if possible
3. Assign additional labels as needed
4. Set priority level
5. Assign to team member (if immediate action needed)
6. Add to project board (if using)
7. Comment with triage results and next steps

**Triage Outcomes:**
- **Accept**: Issue confirmed and prioritized for resolution
- **Needs Info**: Request additional information from reporter
- **Duplicate**: Mark as duplicate and link to original issue
- **Not Reproducible**: Unable to reproduce, request more details
- **By Design**: Behavior is intentional, explain reasoning
- **Won't Fix**: Issue valid but will not be addressed (explain why)

### 3. Issue Resolution Process

**Development Workflow:**
1. Assign issue to developer
2. Create feature branch (if needed)
3. Implement fix/enhancement
4. Test fix thoroughly
5. Create pull request referencing issue
6. Code review process
7. Merge to main branch
8. Deploy to beta testing environment
9. Update issue with resolution details
10. Request reporter verification

**Resolution Documentation:**
- What was changed
- How to verify the fix
- Any new testing scenarios needed
- Impact on other features

### 4. Issue Verification by Beta Testers

**Verification Process:**
1. Beta tester receives notification of resolution
2. Test the fix in beta environment
3. Verify issue is resolved
4. Test for regression in related features
5. Comment on issue with verification results
6. Close issue if verified, or reopen if issue persists
