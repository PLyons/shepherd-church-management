## Testing Methodology

### 1. Role-Based Testing Approach
Each test scenario will be executed from the perspective of relevant user roles to ensure proper access control and workflow functionality.

### 2. User Story-Driven Scenarios
Test cases based on real-world church management workflows:
- "As a pastor, I want to create a church event and track attendance"
- "As a member, I want to view sermon archives and sign up for volunteer opportunities"
- "As an admin, I want to generate annual donation reports for tax compliance"
