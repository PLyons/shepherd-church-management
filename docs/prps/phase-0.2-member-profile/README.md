## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/components/members/profile/
├── MemberProfileHeader.tsx           # Actions, status, navigation
├── MemberProfileTabs.tsx             # Tab navigation component
├── HouseholdSidebar.tsx              # Family relationships
├── tabs/
│   ├── OverviewTab.tsx              # Enhanced current view
│   ├── ActivityTab.tsx              # History and events
│   ├── CommunicationsTab.tsx        # Emails, calls, messages
│   ├── NotesTab.tsx                 # Pastoral notes
│   └── SettingsTab.tsx              # Permissions, preferences
└── common/
    ├── InlineEditField.tsx          # Reusable inline editing
    ├── InfoCard.tsx                 # Consistent info display
    └── MembershipTypeSelector.tsx   # Status dropdown
```

### Routing Structure
```
/members/:id               → Overview tab (default)
/members/:id/activity      → Activity history
/members/:id/communications→ Communications log
/members/:id/notes         → Pastoral notes (pastor/admin only)
/members/:id/settings      → Member preferences (admin only)
```

### State Management
- **React Query** for server state and optimistic updates
- **Local state** for UI interactions (expanded sections, active tab)
- **Context** for edit mode and permissions
- **URL state** for tab persistence
