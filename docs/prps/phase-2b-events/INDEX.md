# Phase 2B: Event Calendar & Attendance System - PRP Index

**Phase Goal**: Implement comprehensive event management system with calendar views, RSVP functionality, and attendance tracking to advance MVP from 50% to 66.7% completion.

## Overview

The Event Calendar & Attendance System provides church staff with tools to create, manage, and track events while enabling members to discover events, RSVP, and participate in church activities. This phase builds on the established Member and Household Management systems to create a cohesive church management platform.

   - AttendanceService and tracking interfaces
   - Bulk check-in and attendance reporting
   - **Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

10. **[PRP-2B-010: Integration & Navigation](PRP-2B-010-integration-navigation.md)**
    - Navigation, routing, and dashboard integration
    - Member profile event history integration
    - **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

## Total Estimated Timeline

**Total Implementation Time**: 34-44 hours
**Recommended Schedule**: 7-10 working days
**Dependencies**: Must complete in sequence due to architectural dependencies

## Context Management Strategy

Each PRP is designed for context-efficient implementation:

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each PRP lists exactly what must be read for context
2. **Self-Contained Tasks**: Each PRP can be completed in a fresh session
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each PRP builds logically on previous work
4. **Validation Points**: Clear success criteria for each milestone

## Notes for Implementation

- **Session Management**: Clear context between PRPs, read CLAUDE.md and specific PRP at start of each session
- **Testing Strategy**: Test each PRP individually before proceeding to next
- **Error Recovery**: Each PRP boundary allows for rollback if issues arise
- **Documentation**: Update project_tracker.md after each completed PRP
