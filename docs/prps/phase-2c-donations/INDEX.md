# Phase 2C: Donation Tracking & Financial Reports - PRP Index

**Phase Goal**: Implement comprehensive donation tracking and financial reporting system to complete MVP functionality, advancing from 98% to 100% completion.

## Overview

The Donation Tracking & Financial Reports system provides church administrators with tools to record, track, and report on donations while enabling members to view their giving history and generate tax statements. This phase builds on the established Member, Household, and Event Management systems to create a complete church management platform with full financial oversight capabilities.

## Context Management Strategy

Each PRP is designed for context-efficient implementation:

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each PRP lists exactly what must be read for context
2. **Self-Contained Tasks**: Each PRP can be completed in a fresh session
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each PRP builds logically on previous work
4. **Validation Points**: Clear success criteria for each milestone

## Notes for Implementation

- **Session Management**: Clear context between PRPs, read CLAUDE.md and specific PRP at start of each session
- **Testing Strategy**: Test each PRP individually before proceeding to next
- **Error Recovery**: Each PRP boundary allows for rollback if issues arise
- **Documentation**: Update project_tracker.md after each completed PRP
- **Security Focus**: Financial data requires extra security validation at each step
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration requires careful testing in sandbox environment
