> **Created**: 2025-09-09  
> **Status**: Ready for Implementation  
> **Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours  
> **Complexity**: High  

## Purpose

Implement a comprehensive Financial Reports Dashboard for administrators that provides detailed analytics, Form 990 compatible reporting, trend analysis, and export capabilities while maintaining appropriate role-based access controls and donor privacy protections.

## Requirements

### Dependencies
- ✅ PRP-2C-001: Donation Data Model & Types
- ✅ PRP-2C-002: Donations Firebase Service  
- ✅ PRP-2C-003: Donation Categories Management
- ✅ PRP-2C-004: Donation Entry Interface
- ✅ PRP-2C-005: Member Donation History
- ✅ PRP-2C-006: Donation Security Rules

### Technical Requirements
- React functional component with TypeScript
- Chart.js/Recharts for data visualization
- React Hook Form for report filtering
- jsPDF for PDF generation
- CSV export functionality
- Role-based access control (admin primary, pastor limited)
- Real-time data updates via Firestore listeners
- Responsive design for desktop-first workflows

## Procedure

### 1. Create Financial Reports Component Structure

Create `src/components/donations/FinancialReports.tsx`:

```typescript
// Component structure with:
// - Report period selector (date ranges)
// - Category breakdown charts
// - Trend analysis graphs
// - Form 990 section mapping
// - Export controls
// - KPI dashboard cards
// - Comparative year-over-year analysis
```

### 2. Implement Report Analytics Logic

**Key Metrics to Display:**
- Total donations by period
- Category breakdown (pie/bar charts)
- Monthly/quarterly trends (line graphs)
- Average donation amounts
- Donor engagement statistics
- Goal tracking vs actual performance
- Form 990 line item summaries

**Chart Components:**
- Monthly donation trends
- Category distribution
- Donor frequency analysis (anonymized)
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Goal progress indicators

### 3. Form 990 Compatible Reporting

**Required Form 990 Sections:**
- Part VIII: Statement of Revenue (Lines 1-12)
- Program service revenue breakdown
- Contributions and grants classification
- Special events revenue (net of expenses)
- Investment income tracking
- Other revenue categorization

**Implementation:**
- Map donation categories to Form 990 line items
- Generate compliant summaries
- Include necessary disclaimers
- Support multiple tax year reporting periods

### 4. Export Functionality

**CSV Export Features:**
- Detailed transaction reports
- Category summaries by date range
- Donor giving reports (admin only)
- Form 990 data export
- Custom field selection

**PDF Report Generation:**
- Executive summary reports
- Visual charts and graphs inclusion
- Form 990 formatted reports
- Branded church letterhead support
- Automated report scheduling (future enhancement)

### 5. Role-Based Access Controls

**Admin Access (Full):**
- All financial data and reports
- Individual donor analysis
- Detailed transaction histories
- Full export capabilities
- Form 990 compliance reports

**Pastor Access (Limited):**
- Aggregate donation statistics only
- Category trends and totals
- Anonymized donor engagement metrics
- No individual donor identification
- Limited export (summary only)

**Member Access:**
- No access to financial reports dashboard
- Redirect to own donation history only

### 6. Privacy Protection Implementation

**Anonymous Donor Protection:**
- Hash donor identifiers in reports
- Aggregate small donations to prevent identification
- Remove personally identifiable information from exports
- Implement data anonymization for pastor-level reports
- Maintain audit trail for admin access

### 7. Real-time Dashboard Features

**KPI Cards:**
- Monthly donation total
- Year-to-date progress
- Average gift size
- Active donor count
- Category performance highlights
- Goal achievement percentage

**Live Updates:**
- Real-time donation notifications
- Auto-refresh dashboard metrics
- Live goal tracking progress
- Recent donation activity feed (admin only)

### 8. Advanced Analytics

**Trend Analysis:**
- Seasonal giving patterns
- Growth rate calculations
- Donor retention analysis
- Category performance trends
- Predictive giving forecasts (basic)

**Comparative Reporting:**
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Month-over-month analysis
- Category performance benchmarks
- Goal vs actual tracking
- Historical trend analysis

### State Management
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Local state for report filters and date ranges
- Context for export operations and loading states
- Firestore real-time listeners for live updates

### Security Considerations
- Validate user role on component mount
- Implement client-side filtering based on permissions
- Secure API endpoints for data export
- Audit log all financial report access
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest

### Performance Optimization
- Implement data pagination for large datasets
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Lazy load chart components
- Cache frequently accessed reports
- Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexing

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Chart data calculation accuracy
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Export functionality validation
- Form 990 mapping correctness
- Privacy protection mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Dashboard data flow end-to-end
- Real-time updates functionality
- Export file generation and download
- Multi-role access scenarios
