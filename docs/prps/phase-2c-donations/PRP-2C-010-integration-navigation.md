# PRP-2C-010: Integration & Navigation

**Phase**: 2C Donation Tracking & Reporting System  
**Task**: 2C.10  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Final integration for complete system  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  

## Purpose

Complete the Donation Tracking & Reporting System integration by adding navigation, routing, dashboard widgets, and member profile integration. This final task brings together all donation system components into a cohesive, fully-integrated feature.

## Context Required

**Essential Files to Read:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Navigation and routing patterns
- `src/components/common/Navigation.tsx` - Main navigation component
- `src/router/index.tsx` - Routing configuration
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard widget patterns
- `src/pages/MemberProfile.tsx` - Profile integration patterns
- All previous PRP outputs (2C.001-2C.009)

## Requirements

**Dependencies:**
- **MUST complete ALL previous Phase 2C PRPs (2C.001-2C.009)**
- All donation system components implemented
- Navigation and routing infrastructure

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Navigation Integration**: Add "Donations" to main navigation menu (role-specific)
2. **Routing Setup**: Configure all donation-related routes
3. **Dashboard Widgets**: Add donation insights to role-based dashboards
4. **Member Profile Integration**: Add "My Giving" section to member profiles
5. **Activity History**: Include donation records in member activity timelines

## Detailed Procedure

### Step 1: Update Main Navigation

Modify `src/components/common/Navigation.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add to navigation items array (role-based visibility)
{
  name: 'Donations',
  href: '/donations',
  icon: CurrencyDollarIcon,
  roles: ['admin'], // Admin only for full donation management
},
{
  name: 'My Giving',
  href: '/my-giving',
  icon: HeartIcon,
  roles: ['member'], // Members see their own giving
},
{
  name: 'Giving Overview',
  href: '/giving-overview',
  icon: ChartBarIcon,
  roles: ['pastor'], // Pastors see aggregate giving insights
},
```

### Step 2: Configure Donation Routes  

Update `src/router/index.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add donation-related routes
{
  path: '/donations',
  element: <Donations />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin'] }
},
{
  path: '/donations/create',
  element: <CreateDonation />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin'] }
},
{
  path: '/donations/:id/edit',
  element: <EditDonation />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin'] }
},
{
  path: '/donations/:id',
  element: <DonationDetails />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin'] }
},
{
  path: '/donations/reports',
  element: <DonationReports />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin'] }
},
{
  path: '/my-giving',
  element: <MyGiving />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['member'] }
},
{
  path: '/giving-overview',
  element: <GivingOverview />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['pastor'] }
},
{
  path: '/quick-donate',
  element: <QuickDonate />,
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, allowedRoles: ['admin', 'pastor'] }
},
```

### Step 3: Add Dashboard Donation Widgets

Update dashboard components to include donation widgets:

```typescript
// For admin dashboards
<DonationInsightsWidget
  title="Donation Summary"
  insights={donationInsights}
  showManagementActions={true}
/>

<QuickActionsWidget
  actions={[
    { name: 'Quick Donation Entry', href: '/quick-donate', icon: PlusIcon },
    { name: 'Donation Reports', href: '/donations/reports', icon: ChartBarIcon },
  ]}
/>

// For pastor dashboards  
<GivingOverviewWidget
  title="Congregation Giving"
  overview={givingOverview}
  showAggregateData={true}
/>

// For member dashboards
<MyGivingWidget
  title="My Giving"
  donations={myDonations}
  showPersonalInsights={true}
/>
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Member Profiles

Add donation sections to member profile:

```typescript
// Add to MemberProfileTabs
<Tab key="giving" title="Giving History">
  <MemberGivingTab memberId={member.id} />
</Tab>

// Add giving summary to profile sidebar
<ProfileSummaryCard title="Giving Summary">
  <GivingSummary memberId={member.id} />
</ProfileSummaryCard>
```

### Step 5: Update Activity History

Integrate donation records into activity timeline:

```typescript
// Add to activity service
async getMemberDonationHistory(memberId: string): Promise<Activity[]> {
  // Fetch donation records for member
  // Convert to Activity format for timeline display
  // Include donation amounts, dates, and designations
}

// Activity timeline entry format
{
  type: 'donation',
  title: 'Donation Made',
  description: `$${amount} donated to ${designation}`,
  date: donationDate,
  icon: CurrencyDollarIcon,
  color: 'green'
}
```

### Step 6: Cross-Feature Integration Points

Add quick donation entry from multiple locations:

```typescript
// From member profile - admin/pastor view
<QuickActionButton
  onClick={() => navigate(`/quick-donate?memberId=${member.id}`)}
  icon={CurrencyDollarIcon}
>
  Record Donation
</QuickActionButton>

// From member directory - admin/pastor view
<MemberActions
  actions={[
    { name: 'Record Donation', action: openQuickDonate, roles: ['admin', 'pastor'] }
  ]}
/>
```
