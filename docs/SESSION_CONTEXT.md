# Session Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-16  
**Current Phase:** Code Quality & Maintenance

## Current Application State

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Development:** ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode

### Environment Status
- **Development Server:** Configured (`npm run dev`)
- **Firebase:** Production environment configured
- **MCP Servers:** 4 active (Serena, Firebase, Semgrep, Context7)
- **Database:** Firestore with security rules implemented

## Recent Session Work (2025-08-16)

### Accomplished
1. **Major Code Quality Improvements**
   - Reduced ESLint issues from 79 to 48 (39% improvement)
   - Fixed all React hooks rule violations (critical for app stability)
   - Converted all TypeScript `any` types to proper typed interfaces
   - Cleaned up unused imports/variables across 26+ files

2. **Security & Type Safety**
   - Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript error types
   - Fixed conditional hook calls that could cause runtime errors
   - Improved Firebase error handling patterns
   - Maintained strict role-based access control

3. **Files Modified (26 files)**
   - Components: RoleManagement, Navigation, MobileMenu, etc.
   - Services: All Firebase services cleaned up
   - Pages: Login, Registration, Admin pages
   - Scripts: Admin setup and seeding scripts

### Current Issues Status
- **48 remaining linting issues** (down from 79)
  - 35 errors (mostly unused variables)
  - 13 warnings (useEffect dependencies + fast refresh)
- **No functionality-blocking issues**

## Development Environment

### Active MCP Servers
1. **Serena** - Code analysis and symbolic editing
2. **Firebase** - Direct Firebase service integration  
3. **Semgrep** - Security scanning and code quality
4. **Context7** - Up-to-date documentation access

### Key Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript validation
npm run format       # Prettier formatting
```

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Complete ESLint cleanup** - Address remaining 48 issues
2. **useEffect dependency fixes** - Resolve 13 dependency warnings
3. **Fast refresh warnings** - Refactor context files if needed

### Medium Priority
1. **Additional testing** - Unit tests for critical components
2. **Performance optimization** - Code splitting and lazy loading
3. **Documentation updates** - Keep technical docs current

## Notes for Next Session
- All critical React hooks issues have been resolved
- TypeScript type safety significantly improved
- Code is stable and production-ready
- Focus should be on completing the cosmetic linting issues
- Consider implementing comprehensive error boundaries
- MCP servers are properly configured and working efficiently

## Beta Testing Status
- **Environment:** Ready for testing
- **Core Features:** All functional
- **Known Issues:** None critical, only linting cosmetics
- **Test Data:** Available via seeding scripts
