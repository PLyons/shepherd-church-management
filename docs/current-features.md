**Next Phase**: Ready for systematic reimplementation of additional features  

The current implementation provides a solid, tested foundation that can support gradual feature expansion while maintaining security, performance, and user experience standards.

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth â†’ AuthContext â†’ Route Guards
2. **Data Access**: Components â†’ Firebase Service Layer â†’ Firestore Database
3. **Real-time Updates**: Firestore Listeners â†’ Service Layer â†’ Component State
4. **Security**: Firebase Security Rules + Role-based UI controls

This architecture ensures data consistency, security, and real-time collaboration while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
