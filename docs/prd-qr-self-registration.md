# PRD: QR Code Self-Registration System

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive QR code-based self-registration system that allows church visitors and members to register themselves without authentication. The system generates QR codes that can be displayed at church entrances, printed on bulletins, or shared digitally, leading to a mobile-friendly registration form with complete analytics and automated follow-up workflows.

**🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: FULLY COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Phases 1-4**: Core infrastructure, token management, public registration, and approval workflow
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard with advanced data visualization
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Enhanced QR display options with PDF generation and automated follow-up system

## Problem Statement
Currently, new visitors and members must be manually added by administrators, creating a bottleneck and potentially missing visitor information. Churches need a streamlined way to capture visitor information immediately when they attend services.

## Solution Overview
A two-part system:
1. **Admin Side**: QR code generation and management interface for church staff
2. **Public Side**: Mobile-optimized registration form accessible via QR scan (no authentication required)

## User Stories

### As a Church Administrator
- I want to generate QR codes for different events/services
- I want to track how many people register through each QR code
- I want to review and approve registrations before they become members
- I want to detect and merge duplicate registrations

### As a Church Visitor
- I want to quickly register by scanning a QR code
- I want to submit my information without creating an account
- I want to indicate whether I'm a visitor or member
- I want the form to work well on my mobile device
