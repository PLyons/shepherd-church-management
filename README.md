- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Firebase account (free tier)
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PLyons/shepherd-church-management.git
   cd shepherd-church-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Email Link)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Enable Storage
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your Firebase config (optional - defaults are provided)

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access Application**
   - **App**: http://localhost:5173
   - **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - **Default Admin**: Set up using `npm run setup-admin`

### Database Setup

#### Firebase Setup
1. **Initialize Firestore**
   - Firebase automatically creates collections on first use
   - Security rules are defined in `firestore.rules`

2. **Seed Data**
   ```bash
   # Seed data into Firebase
   npm run seed
   ```

3. **Create Admin User**
   ```bash
   # Set up initial admin user
   npm run setup-admin
