# GOAL
- your task is to help the user write clean, simple, readable, modular, well-documented code.
- do exactly what the user asks for, nothing more, nothing less.
- think hard, like a Senior Developer would.

# ABOUT Shepherd Church Management System
- this codebase is for our app named "Shepherd"
- A React + TypeScript church management system focused on core membership functionality, built with Vite and Firebase.
- I am a sole developer relying on AI to peform my coding tasks
- we CANNOT overthink & over-engineer things. we have to look for the 80/20 solution.

# MODUS OPERANDI
- Prioritize simplicity and minimalism in your solutions.
- Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.

# TECH STACK
- Frontend

  - React - UI framework with functional components and hooks
  - TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript with strict mode enabled
  - Vite - Build tool and development server
  - React Router - Client-side routing
  - React Hook Form - Form validation and management
  - TailwindCSS - Utility-first CSS framework
  - Chart.js - Data visualization for financial reports

  Backend & Database

  - Firebase - Complete backend-as-a-service
    - Firestore - NoSQL document database
    - Firebase Auth - Authentication with magic links
    - Firebase Security Rules - Database-level access control
    - Firebase Admin SDK - Server-side operations

  Development Tools

  - ESLint - Code linting with TypeScript/React rules
  - Prettier - Code formatting
  - npm - Package management
  - Git - Version control

  Testing & Quality

  - Vitest - Testing framework (TDD methodology - 80/90/95% coverage targets)
  - Playwright - Browser automation and UI testing
  - Semgrep - Security scanning
  - Test-Driven Development - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle mandatory for all development

  Architecture Patterns

  - Service Layer - Firebase service implementations extending
  BaseFirestoreService
  - Context Providers - AuthContext, ThemeContext, ToastContext
  - Role-based Access Control (RBAC) - Admin/Pastor/Member roles
  - Real-time Updates - Firestore listeners for live data sync

  Key Constraints

  - Free-tier Firebase limits during development
  - Desktop-first administrative workflows
  - No global state management libraries (Redux avoided)
  - Environment variables via .env files

# DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENTS
- Currently only in development mode with no deployed environments yet

# DATABASE
-  Database Architecture

  - Firebase Firestore - NoSQL document database as the primary data store
  - Service Layer Pattern - All database operations go through Firebase services extending BaseFirestoreService
  - Real-time Synchronization - Firestore listeners provide live data updates across the application

  Data Translation & Type Safety

  - Single Translation Layer - src/utils/firestore-converters.ts is the ONLY translation between TypeScript and Firestore
  - Consistent Field Naming - Both TypeScript and Firestore use camelCase (firstName, lastName, memberStatus)
  - Type-Safe Conversions - Converter functions like memberToMemberDocument() and memberDocumentToMember()
  - Strict TypeScript - NEVER use any types, always specify proper types

  Security & Access Control

  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Admin/Pastor/Member roles enforced at database level
  - Firebase Security Rules - Database-level access control preventing unauthorized data access
  - Principle of Least Privilege - Members only see their own data, pastors see member info for care, admins see everything
  - Financial Data Protection - Enhanced security rules for donation and financial data

  Data Integrity Patterns

  - Audit Logging - Track sensitive data access and role changes
  - Decimal Precision - Proper handling of financial amounts and currency calculations
  - Data Validation - Form validation before database writes
  - Consistent CRUD Patterns - Standardized create, read, update, delete operations across all services

  Core Collections Structure

  - Members - Core member profiles with household relationships
  - Households - Family/household groupings with primary contacts
  - Events - Church events with RSVP and attendance tracking
  - Donations - Financial contributions with category classification
  - Roles - User permission management

  Critical Constraints

  - Free-tier Firebase limits during development
  - Never bypass service layer - All database access must go through Firebase services
  - Security rules enforcement - All user data access must respect Firebase Security Rules
  - Data accuracy requirement - Member data, donations, and events must be 100% accurate

  Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

  - ❌ Direct Firestore queries bypassing service layer
  - ❌ Creating multiple translation systems
  - ❌ Using any types instead of proper TypeScript interfaces
  - ❌ Hardcoding security logic in components instead of using Firebase Security Rules
  - ❌ **NEVER implement features without comprehensive test coverage (TDD mandatory)**
  - ❌ **NEVER bypass RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle in development**


# API
  No External APIs

  - Self-contained system - All functionality built on Firebase
  - No third-party integrations mentioned in documentation
  - Free-tier constraints - Designed to work within Firebase free limits

# VERSION CONTROL
- we use git for version control
- Multi-Machine Development

  Start work: git pull origin main
  End work: git add . && git commit -m "WIP: switching to [machine]" && git push origin main

  Setup: Clone repo → npm install → Copy .env.example to .env → Configure MCP servers

  That's the entirety of the dedicated git section. There are also a few other git-related references scattered throughout the
  document, such as:

  - Quality checks section mentions running linting/typecheck before commits
  - GitHub MCP integration for PR creation
  - References to the current branch status in the gitStatus section
  - Commit message examples in the recent commits section

# COMMENTS
- every file should have clear Header Comments at the top, explaining where the file is, and what it does
- all comments should be clear, simple and easy-to-understand
- when writing code, make sure to add comments to the most complex / non-obvious parts of the code
- it is better to add more comments than less

# UI DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- the UI of Shepherd needs to be simple and clean.
- we aim to achive great UI/UX, just like Apple or ChatGPT does

- Primary Color Scheme

  - Blue - Primary brand color
    - bg-blue-100 - Light backgrounds, badges
    - bg-blue-600 - Primary buttons
    - bg-blue-700 - Button hover states
    - text-blue-800 - Primary text on light backgrounds

  - Neutral Grays (Most Common)

  - Gray - Main UI framework
    - bg-gray-50 - Page backgrounds
    - bg-gray-100 - Card backgrounds, secondary badges
    - bg-gray-200 - Borders, dividers
    - text-gray-600 - Primary text content
    - text-gray-500 - Secondary text
    - text-gray-400 - Disabled/muted text
    - text-gray-900 - Headings, emphasis

  - Status & Feedback Colors

  - Green - Success states, positive actions
  - Red - Error states, destructive actions
  - Yellow/Amber - Warning states

  - Semantic Usage Patterns

  - Primary content: text-gray-900 (headings), text-gray-600 (body)
  - Secondary content: text-gray-500
  - Interactive elements: Blue variants for buttons and links
  - Status indicators: Blue for primary badges, gray for secondary
  - Form elements: Gray backgrounds with blue accents for focus states

# HEADER COMMENTS
- EVERY file HAS TO start with 4 lines of comments!
1. exact file location in codebase
2. clear description of what this file does
3. clear description of WHY this file exists
4. RELEVANT FILES:comma-separated list of 2-4 most relevant files
- NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.

# SIMPLICITY
- Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
- do not add unnecessary complications. SIMPLE = GOOD, COMPLEX = BAD.
- Implement precisely what the user asks for, without additional features or complexity.
- the fewer lines of code, the better.

# QUICK AND DIRTY PROTOTYPE
- this is a very important concept you must understand
- when adding new features, always start by creating the "quick and dirty prototype" first
- this is the 80/20 approach taken to its zenith

# HELP THE USER LEARN
- when coding, always explain what you are doing and why
- your job is to help the user learn & upskill himself, above all
- assume the user is an intelligent, tech savvy person -- but do not assume he knows the details
- explain everything clearly, simply, in easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences.

# RESTRICTIONS
- NEVER push to github unless the User explicitly tells you to
- DO NOT run 'npm run build' unless the User tells you to
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less

# ACTIVE CONTRIBUTORS
- **User (Human)**: Works in VS Code IDE & Claude Code in a mac terminal window, directs the project, makes high-level decisions, has the best taste & judgement.
- **VS Code**: AI copilot activated by User, lives in the VS Code IDE, medium level of autonomy, can edit multiple files at once, can run terminal commands, can access the whole codebase; the User uses it to vibe-code the app.
- **AI Agents, such as Codex or Claude Code**: Terminal-based AI agents with high autonomy, can edit multiple files simultaneously, understands entire codebase automatically, runs tests/Git operations, handles large-scale refactoring and complex debugging independently

# FILE LENGTH
- we must keep all files under 300 LOC.
- right now, our codebase still has many files that break this
- files must be modular & single-purpose

# READING FILES
- always read the file in full, do not be lazy
- before making any code changes, start by finding & reading ALL of the relevant files
- never make changes without reading the entire file

# EGO
- do not make assumption. do not jump to conclusions.
- you are just a Large Language Model, you are very limited.
- always consider multiple different approaches, just like a Senior Developer would

# CUSTOM CODE
- in general, I prefer to write custom code rather than adding external dependencies
- especially for the core functionality of the app (backend, infra, core business logic)
- it's fine to use some libraries / packages in the frontend, for complex things
- however as our codebase, userbase and company grows, we should seek to write everything custom

# WRITING STYLE
- each long sentence should be followed by two newline characters
- avoid long bullet lists
- write in natural, plain English. be conversational.
- avoid using overly complex language, and super long sentences
- use simple & easy-to-understand language. be concise.

# DATABASE CHANGES
- you have no power or authority to make any database changes unless explicitly granted by the user
- only the User himself can make DB changes, whether Dev or Prod
- if you want to make any Database-related change, suggest it first to the User
- NEVER EVER attempt to run any DB migrations, or make any database changes. this is strictly prohibited.

# TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
**MANDATORY:** All development must follow established TDD practices with comprehensive test coverage.

## TDD Requirements
- **Coverage Targets:** 80% minimum / 90% core logic / 95% financial & security
- **Test-First Development:** Write failing tests before implementing features
- **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle:** Follow strict TDD methodology
- **Quality Gates:** All tests must pass before feature completion

## TDD Documentation
- **Daily Workflow:** [docs/TDD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md](docs/TDD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md) - Essential commands and patterns
- **Complete Guide:** [docs/AGENT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md](docs/AGENT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md) - Step-by-step implementation
- **Architecture Reference:** [CLAUDE.md TDD Section](CLAUDE.md#test-driven-development-tdd-methodology)
- **Working Examples:** Phase 2C implementation (180+ passing tests) demonstrates TDD excellence

## Implementation Process
1. **Read requirements** from PRP documentation
2. **Write failing tests** that define expected behavior (RED)
3. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor and optimize** while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
5. **Verify coverage** meets targets before completion

**Achievement Status:** TDD methodology ESTABLISHED and MANDATORY for all future development.

# OUTPUT STYLE
- write in complete, clear sentences. like a Senior Developer when talking to a junior engineer
- always provide enough context for the user to understand -- in a simple & short way
- make sure to clearly explain your assumptions, and your conclusions
