# Firebase Security Rules Testing Suite

This comprehensive test suite validates the enhanced donation security rules implemented in **PRP-2C-004: Enhanced Firestore Security Rules for Financial Data Protection**.

## Overview

The security rules test suite ensures that:
- **Members** can only access their own financial data
- **Pastors** have NO access to individual donations (only aggregate summaries)
- **Admins** have full access with proper audit logging
- Time-limited edits (24-hour window) are enforced
- Status-based security prevents editing verified/cancelled donations
- Data validation prevents invalid or malicious data

## Test Structure

### Test Categories

1. **Authentication Tests** - Verify unauthenticated access is denied
2. **Donation Categories Security** - Role-based access to categories
3. **Donations Security** - Core financial data protection
4. **Donation Summaries Security** - Aggregate reporting access control  
5. **Financial Audit Log Security** - Admin-only audit trail access
6. **Collection Group Query Security** - Cross-collection query restrictions
7. **Time-Based Security Tests** - 24-hour edit window enforcement
8. **Status-Based Security Tests** - Pending vs verified donation restrictions
9. **Edge Cases and Security Vulnerabilities** - Anti-tampering and privilege escalation prevention

### Test Data

The test suite uses comprehensive mock data including:
- **Test Users**: Admin, Pastor, Member (multiple)
- **Donation Categories**: Active, inactive, various fund types
- **Donations**: Different statuses, ages, amounts, and ownership
- **Summaries**: Aggregate and individual donor summaries
- **Audit Logs**: Various financial access events

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Firebase CLI** - Install globally: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. **Firebase Rules Unit Testing SDK** - Installed via: `npm install --save-dev @firebase/rules-unit-testing`

```

#### Option 3: Advanced Test Runner Options

```bash
# Full test runner with options
./__tests__/security/run-security-tests.sh --help

# Skip environment validation
./__tests__/security/run-security-tests.sh --skip-validation

# Keep emulator running after tests
./__tests__/security/run-security-tests.sh --keep-emulator
```

### Test Environment Setup

The test runner automatically:
1. **Validates Environment**:
   - ‚úÖ Firebase CLI installation
   - ‚úÖ Security rules file exists
   - ‚úÖ Test dependencies installed
   - ‚úÖ Test files present

2. **Emulator Management**:
   - üöÄ Starts Firebase emulator on port 8080
   - ‚è≥ Waits for emulator to be ready
   - üßπ Cleans up processes after tests

3. **Test Execution**:
   - üß™ Runs comprehensive security validation
   - üìä Provides detailed test results
   - üéØ Validates all role-based access scenarios

### Test Environment Setup

The test suite automatically:
1. **Initializes** Firebase emulator with security rules
2. **Creates** test contexts for different user roles
3. **Seeds** mock data for comprehensive testing
4. **Cleans** up between tests for isolation
5. **Validates** both success and failure scenarios

## Security Test Scenarios

- Read own donations only
- Create donations for themselves (pending status)
- Update own pending donations within 24 hours
- Read active donation categories

**‚ùå Denied:**
- Read other members' donations
- Create donations for other members
- Update verified/cancelled donations
- Update donations after 24-hour window
- Delete any donations
- Access donation summaries
- Access audit logs
- Write to donation categories

### Pastor Access Control

**‚úÖ Allowed:**
- Read all donation categories (active/inactive)

- Create aggregate summaries

**‚ùå Denied:**
- Read individual donations (ANY donations)
- Write to donations collection

- **Cancelled Donations**: Only admin can edit

## Collection Group Security

### Cross-Collection Queries

Tests validate:
- **Admin**: Can query across all financial collections
- **Pastor**: Limited to aggregate summaries only
- **Member**: Can only access own data in queries
- **Filtering**: Security rules properly filter results

## Anti-Tampering and Security Vulnerabilities

### Privilege Escalation Prevention

- Members cannot create verified donations
- Members cannot assign donations to other members
- Members cannot modify createdBy, createdAt fields
- Pastors cannot access individual financial records

### Data Integrity Protection

- Critical fields (memberId, status, timestamps) cannot be tampered with
- Role-based access prevents unauthorized privilege escalation
- Collection group queries are properly filtered by user access rights

## Audit Logging Requirements

### Financial Access Auditing

- All admin financial data access triggers audit requirements
- Audit logs are admin-only accessible
- System-level audit entries supported for Cloud Functions

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides:
- **Authentication**: 100% coverage of unauthenticated access denial
- **Role-Based Access**: Complete validation of admin/pastor/member permissions
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive field and type validation
- **Time/Status Security**: Full coverage of temporal and status restrictions
- **Edge Cases**: Anti-tampering, privilege escalation, bulk operations
- **Performance**: Query security and filtering validation

## Development Usage

### Adding New Security Tests

1. **Identify Security Requirement**: Define what should be protected
2. **Create Test Scenarios**: Both positive (allowed) and negative (denied) cases
3. **Use assertSucceeds/assertFails**: Validate security rule behavior
4. **Test All Roles**: Admin, Pastor, Member, Unauthenticated
5. **Include Edge Cases**: Data tampering, privilege escalation attempts

### Debugging Security Rules
