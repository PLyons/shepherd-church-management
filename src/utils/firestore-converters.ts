// src/utils/firestore-converters.ts
// Legacy export aggregator for backward compatibility with refactored converter architecture
// Provides seamless transition to new modular converter structure while maintaining existing import paths
// RELEVANT FILES: src/utils/converters/index.ts, src/utils/converters/member-converters.ts, src/utils/converters/household-converters.ts, src/utils/converters/donation-converters.ts

// DEPRECATED: This file is kept for backward compatibility
// New modular structure is located in src/utils/converters/
// All functions are re-exported from the new location
