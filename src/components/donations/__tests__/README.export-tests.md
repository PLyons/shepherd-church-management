# MemberDonationHistory Export Tests

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite for PDF generation and export functionality in the MemberDonationHistory component, written following TDD RED phase principles to define expected export behavior.

## Test Coverage Areas

### 1. PDF Tax Statement Generation (25 tests)

- PDF generation with member donation data
- Tax-compliant formatting and layout
- Church letterhead and contact information
- Member information display
- Year-to-date summaries
- Tax-deductible amount calculations
- PDF download functionality
- Proper filename generation

### 2. CSV Export Functionality (8 tests)

- CSV export with all donation fields
- Proper CSV formatting and headers
- Date and currency formatting
- CSV download functionality
- Large dataset export handling
- Error handling

### 3. Print Functionality (5 tests)

- Print-friendly styling
- Print layout optimization
- Page breaks for long histories
- Print preview functionality

### 4. Annual Statement Generation (6 tests)

- Annual giving statement generation
- Tax year filtering
- Multiple year options
- IRS-compliant language
- Digital signatures/verification codes

### 5. Export Performance (4 tests)

- PDF generation speed (<5 seconds)
- Large dataset handling (10,000+ records)
- Memory management
- Concurrent export requests

### 6. Export Security (6 tests)

- No server-side file storage
- Secure PDF generation
- Temporary data cleanup
- Access control enforcement
- Member data validation
- Error message sanitization

### 7. Export Error Handling (6 tests)

- PDF library failures
- Blob creation errors
- Loading states
- Browser compatibility
- Automatic retry logic
- User-friendly error messages

## Total Tests: 60+ comprehensive test cases

## Libraries Mocked

- `jspdf` - PDF generation library
- `react-pdf` - Alternative PDF generation
- `papaparse` - CSV parsing/generation
- File download APIs (`URL.createObjectURL`, `document.createElement`)

## Performance Requirements

- PDF generation: <5 seconds for standard donation history
- Large dataset export: <10 seconds for 10,000+ records
- Memory cleanup: Automatic blob URL revocation
- Concurrent exports: Support multiple simultaneous exports

## Security Requirements

- No server-side file storage during generation
- Proper access control validation
- Sensitive error message filtering
- Temporary data cleanup
- Role-based export permissions

## Expected Coverage Target

- **90%+ export feature coverage** as required for financial features
- **95% security test coverage** for financial data protection
- **100% error handling coverage** for production reliability

## Implementation Notes

All tests are written in the RED phase before implementation to:

1. Define expected export behavior
2. Ensure comprehensive error handling
3. Validate security requirements
4. Test performance benchmarks
5. Verify tax-compliance formatting

The tests will guide implementation of the MemberDonationHistory component's export features.
