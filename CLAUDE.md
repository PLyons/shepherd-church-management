# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Service Layer Architecture
The codebase uses a Firebase-based service layer pattern:
- `src/services/firebase/` - Firebase service implementations
- Core services: members, households, events, roles, donations
- All services extend BaseFirestoreService for consistent patterns

### **CRITICAL: Data Translation & Type Conversion**
**ALWAYS use the existing translation system - DO NOT create new ones!**

- **`src/utils/firestore-converters.ts`** - The ONLY translation layer between TypeScript and Firestore
- Contains `memberToMemberDocument()` and `memberDocumentToMember()` converters
- **TypeScript uses camelCase, Firestore ALSO uses camelCase** (via converters)
- **DO NOT use `firestore-field-mapper.ts`** - this is for different use cases
- **Firebase Security Rules expect camelCase** (firstName, lastName, memberStatus)

**Before changing ANY data layer code:**
1. Check existing converter functions first
2. Understand what translation system is already in place
3. Never assume field naming conventions without checking the converters

### Component Organization
Components are organized by feature in `src/components/`:
- `members/` - Member management components
- `households/` - Household management components
- `auth/` - Authentication and role guards
- `admin/` - Administrative functions (role management)
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard views by role
- `common/` - Shared UI components
- `donations/` - Donation tracking and financial components
- Page-level components in `src/pages/`

### Type Definitions
All TypeScript types are centralized in `src/types/`:
- `index.ts` - Core domain models (Member, Household)
- `events.ts` - Event system types (Event, EventRSVP, EventAttendance)
- `donations.ts` - Donation system types (Donation, DonationCategory, DonationReport)
- `firestore.ts` - Firebase/Firestore schema types
- Clean, Firebase-focused type definitions

### Data Management Patterns
- **Firestore Converters**: `src/utils/firestore-converters.ts` - Type-safe Firestore document conversion
- **Service Layer**: Firebase services with consistent CRUD patterns
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners for live data synchronization
- **Role-based Data Access**: Security enforced at service layer

### Authentication & Authorization
The system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system with three primary roles:
- `admin` - Full system access including member management, household management, and system settings
- `pastor` - Access to member information for pastoral care, household management
- `member` - Limited access to own data and basic directory information

**Critical Security Principle**: Members should only see their own data and limited information about other members. Role-based access is enforced at both the component and service level.

### Context Providers
Three main contexts manage global state:
- `AuthContext` - Authentication and user state
- `ThemeContext` - Dark/light theme
- `ToastContext` - Toast notifications


## Code Standards
- Follow **Prettier** formatting defaults
- Use **ESLint** with recommended TypeScript and React rules
- Prefer **functional components** and **React hooks**
- Use **async/await** over `.then()` syntax
- Avoid magic strings/numbers ‚Äî define constants where applicable
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

**MANDATORY:** All new development must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices as established in Phase 2C foundation layers.

### TDD Workflow Requirements
**RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle:**
1. **RED Phase:** Write failing tests first that define expected behavior
2. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Coverage Targets by Feature Type
- **Overall Application:** 80% minimum test coverage
- **Core Business Logic:** 90% minimum test coverage (member/household/event management)
- **Financial & Security Features:** 95% minimum test coverage (donations, authentication, role-based access)
- **UI Components:** 85% minimum test coverage (user interaction scenarios)

### Test Organization Structure
```
src/[feature]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature].unit.test.ts        # Pure business logic tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature].integration.test.ts # Service interaction tests  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature].security.test.ts    # Role-based access & validation tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Component].test.tsx          # React component tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature].service.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Component].tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
```

### Essential TDD Commands
```bash
# TDD Development Workflow
npm run test -- --watch              # Watch mode for active development
npm run test:coverage                 # Generate coverage reports (80%+ required)
npm run test -- --grep="[feature]"   # Run specific test group
npm run test -- --bail               # Stop on first failure for debugging

# Quality Assurance
npm run test:coverage -- --threshold=80    # Enforce minimum coverage
npm run test -- --grep="security"          # Run security-specific tests
npm run test -- --grep="integration"       # Run integration tests
```

### TDD Implementation Standards
- **Write tests first** - Always begin with failing tests that define expected behavior
- **Test all error conditions** - Include validation errors, service failures, and edge cases
- **Mock external dependencies** - Keep tests isolated and fast with proper mocking
- **Test role-based access** - Verify admin/pastor/member permissions in security tests
- **Firebase emulator integration** - Use Firebase emulators for integration testing

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before code completion
- Coverage targets must be met for feature acceptance
- Security tests must verify role-based access control
- Integration tests must validate Firebase service interactions

### TDD Documentation References
- **Quick Reference:** `docs/TDD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Essential commands and patterns
- **Agent Workflow:** `docs/AGENT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md` - Step-by-step TDD implementation guide
- **Test Examples:** Phase 2C foundation layers (PRP-2C-001 through PRP-2C-004) demonstrate comprehensive TDD patterns

**Achievement:** Phase 2C donation system foundation implemented with 151+ passing tests demonstrating excellence in TDD methodology.

### TypeScript Type Safety (MANDATORY)
- **NEVER use `any` types** - Always specify proper types
- Use `unknown` for truly unknown data, then narrow with type guards
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` for generic objects instead of `any`
- Use proper union types (`string | number`) instead of `any`
- Use `@ts-expect-error` with explanation instead of `@ts-ignore`
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode - avoid type assertion unless absolutely necessary

### React & TypeScript Naming Conventions (MANDATORY)
1. **Never use snake_case** - Use camelCase for variables, functions, props
2. **PascalCase mandatory** - Components, interfaces, types
3. **React conventions** - Event handlers: `onClick`, State: `setAge`, Hooks: `useAuth`
4. **Constants** - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

## Project-Wide Constraints
- No use of paid services during development (must run on free-tier limits)
- Environment secrets must be passed via `.env` files and never hardcoded
- No global state libraries (e.g., Redux) unless scoped locally
- Firebase Security Rules must be enforced for all user data access
- All database changes must be done via Firebase service layer and Firestore

2. Firestore security rules for financial data
3. Donation entry form with validation
4. Financial reports dashboard with role filtering
5. Member donation history and statements

## MCP Servers Integration

**MANDATORY: Use MCP servers proactively for all tasks**

### Required Usage:
- **Serena**: Code analysis with `get_symbols_overview` and `find_symbol` (never read entire files)
- **Context7**: Current documentation for libraries/frameworks  
- **Firebase MCP**: Database operations instead of CLI
- **Playwright**: UI testing on `http://localhost:5173`
- **Semgrep**: Security scanning before commits
- **GitHub MCP**: PR creation and issue management

### Server Setup:
- **Serena**: `claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server`
- **Firebase**: `npx -y firebase-tools@latest experimental:mcp`  
- **Context7**: `claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`
- **GitHub**: `claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp`
- **Management**: `claude mcp list` | `claude --debug mcp list`

### Key Tools:
- **Serena**: `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `replace_symbol_body`, `write_memory`
- **Firebase**: `mcp__firebase__firestore_*`, `mcp__firebase__auth_*`
- **Playwright**: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_network_requests`
- **Semgrep**: `semgrep_scan`, `get_scan_results`

## Multi-Machine Development

**Start work**: `git pull origin main`
**End work**: `git add . && git commit -m "WIP: switching to [machine]" && git push origin main`

**Setup**: Clone repo ‚Üí `npm install` ‚Üí Copy `.env.example` to `.env` ‚Üí Configure MCP servers

## PRP Task Format

**Structure**: Purpose (what/why) ‚Üí Requirements (dependencies) ‚Üí Procedure (exact steps)

## CRITICAL: Information Accuracy

**Never provide information unless factually correct from documented sources.**

**Protocol**: No assumptions ‚Üí Use WebFetch for verification ‚Üí Admit knowledge gaps ‚Üí "I need to check documentation" not guessing

## Critical Standards

1. **Data Accuracy**: Member data, donations, and events must be 100% accurate
2. **Security**: Implement proper authentication checks and data validation
3. **Desktop-First**: All features optimized for desktop administrative workflows
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript strictly - **NEVER use `any` types**
5. **Error Handling**: Always provide user-friendly error messages

## **DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY**
1. **Identify actual error** - Don't assume from symptoms
2. **Check imports/dependencies** - Circular deps cause "uninitialized variable" errors  
3. **Use existing patterns** - Look at working code first
4. **Test simple fixes** - Don't overcomplicate
5. **Understand architecture** - Read converters, service patterns
6. **Make minimal changes** - Fix actual problem only

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create service interface in `src/services/`
2. Implement Firebase service in `src/services/firebase/`
3. Create TypeScript types in `src/types/`
4. Build components in appropriate feature folder
5. Add route if needed in `src/router/`
6. Update relevant context if state management needed

### Working with Forms
- Use React Hook Form for all forms
- Implement proper validation with clear error messages
- Follow existing patterns in `src/components/*/forms/`

### Database Operations
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Implement proper security rules in Firebase Console
- Follow existing patterns for real-time updates using Firestore listeners

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- `VITE_USE_FIREBASE` - Toggle between Supabase and Firebase
- `VITE_FIREBASE_*` - Firebase configuration
- `VITE_SUPABASE_*` - Supabase configuration (legacy)

## Session Management

### Session Startup Protocol
1. **Always read** this CLAUDE.md file first to establish context
2. **Check** `docs/project_tracker.md` for current progress and next tasks
3. **Verify** which phase we're in and any dependencies
4. **Start local development** with `npm run dev` (Firebase runs in cloud)
5. **Confirm** database seeding and authentication working
6. **Review** any session notes from previous work

### Task Execution Order
- **Follow the order** specified in project_tracker.md strictly
- **Verify dependencies** before executing any task
- **Complete each phase** before moving to the next to maintain architectural integrity

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Use exact names** for tables, columns, and routes as specified in task files
- **Reference existing code** when implementing related features
- **Maintain consistency** with previously implemented patterns and components

### Testing Protocol
- **Test incrementally** after creating each schema with a test insert
- **Verify security rules** work correctly before implementing UI components
- **Test each UI component** with different user roles (admin, pastor, member)
- **Confirm integrations** work (e.g., auth triggers, foreign key constraints)

### Error Handling
- **Flag potential issues** proactively during implementation
- **Request clarification** immediately when requirements are ambiguous
- **Document workarounds** if standard approaches don't work
- **Never skip error handling** in production code

### Quality Assurance
- **Follow TypeScript** best practices with proper typing
- **Implement loading states** and error boundaries in React components
- **Ensure desktop efficiency** using TailwindCSS utilities for administrative workflows
- **Apply Firebase Security Rules** consistently across all collections

## Coordination Protocol

If you are unsure of assumptions or hit ambiguous scope:
- Prompt the human architect with exact question
- Halt implementation until confirmed

## Security & Roles System

### Current Role Structure
The application uses three primary roles stored on Member documents:
- **`admin`** - Full system administrator
- **`pastor`** - Church leadership with pastoral care access
- **`member`** - Regular church member with limited access

### Critical Security Requirements

#### Member Role Access (Principle of Least Privilege)
**Members should ONLY see:**
- ‚úÖ Own profile and household information
- ‚úÖ Own donation history only
- ‚úÖ Upcoming public events (not private/admin events)
- ‚úÖ Limited church directory (names, public contact info only)
- ‚úÖ Own event RSVPs and attendance
- ‚ùå **NEVER** other members' donations or financial details
- ‚ùå **NEVER** private member information or pastoral notes
- ‚ùå **NEVER** administrative functions or reports

#### Pastor Role Access (Pastoral Care Focus)
**Pastors should have access to:**
- ‚úÖ All member information for pastoral care purposes
- ‚úÖ Event creation and management (all events)
- ‚úÖ Aggregate donation reports (not individual line items unless pastoral need)
- ‚úÖ Full church directory and member engagement analytics
- ‚úÖ Event attendance tracking across all events
- ‚ùå System administration functions
- ‚ùå User role assignments
- ‚ùå Individual donation details without specific justification

#### Admin Role Access (Full System Access)
**Admins have complete access to:**
- ‚úÖ All financial data and detailed reports
- ‚úÖ User role management and system configuration
- ‚úÖ All analytics, reporting, and data export/import
- ‚úÖ Audit logs and system monitoring
- ‚úÖ Database administration functions

### Implementation Priorities

#### Phase 1 (Critical Security)
1. **Dashboard filtering** - Implement role-based data filtering on all dashboard views
2. **Financial data security** - Ensure members only see own donations
3. **Role assignment system** - Admin-only interface for managing roles
4. **Audit logging** - Track all role changes and sensitive data access

#### Phase 2 (Enhanced Permissions)
1. **Granular permissions system** - Permission-based access beyond just roles
2. **Additional roles** - Treasurer, volunteer coordinator, ministry leader
3. **Role expiration** - Time-limited role assignments
4. **Approval workflows** - Multi-step approval for sensitive access

**CRITICAL**: Default to restricting access. Members only see own data, pastors see member info for care, admins see everything.


## Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL: Use environment date as authoritative source for "today's date" - never use existing doc dates**

**Documentation Hierarchy**: CLAUDE.md (this file) ‚Üí docs/INDEX.md ‚Üí README.md ‚Üí docs/*

**Key Requirements**: 
- Update docs with feature changes
- Include update timestamps  
- Archive obsolete content to docs/archive/
- Maintain accuracy - never contradict implementation
