```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Service Layer Architecture
The codebase uses a Firebase-based service layer pattern:
- `src/services/firebase/` - Firebase service implementations
- Core services: members, households, roles
- All services extend BaseFirestoreService for consistent patterns

### **CRITICAL: Data Translation & Type Conversion**
**ALWAYS use the existing translation system - DO NOT create new ones!**

- **`src/utils/firestore-converters.ts`** - The ONLY translation layer between TypeScript and Firestore
- Contains `memberToMemberDocument()` and `memberDocumentToMember()` converters
- **TypeScript uses camelCase, Firestore ALSO uses camelCase** (via converters)
- **DO NOT use `firestore-field-mapper.ts`** - this is for different use cases
- **Firebase Security Rules expect camelCase** (firstName, lastName, memberStatus)

**Before changing ANY data layer code:**
1. Check existing converter functions first
2. Understand what translation system is already in place
3. Never assume field naming conventions without checking the converters

### Component Organization
Components are organized by feature in `src/components/`:
- `members/` - Member management components
- `households/` - Household management components
- `auth/` - Authentication and role guards
- `admin/` - Administrative functions (role management)
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard views by role
- `common/` - Shared UI components
- Page-level components in `src/pages/`

### Type Definitions
All TypeScript types are centralized in `src/types/`:
- `index.ts` - Core domain models (Member, Household)
- `firestore.ts` - Firebase/Firestore schema types
- Clean, Firebase-focused type definitions

### Data Management Patterns
- **Firestore Converters**: `src/utils/firestore-converters.ts` - Type-safe Firestore document conversion
- **Service Layer**: Firebase services with consistent CRUD patterns
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners for live data synchronization
- **Role-based Data Access**: Security enforced at service layer

### Authentication & Authorization
The system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system with three primary roles:
- `admin` - Full system access including member management, household management, and system settings
- `pastor` - Access to member information for pastoral care, household management
- `member` - Limited access to own data and basic directory information

**Critical Security Principle**: Members should only see their own data and limited information about other members. Role-based access is enforced at both the component and service level.

### Context Providers
Three main contexts manage global state:
- `AuthContext` - Authentication and user state
- `ThemeContext` - Dark/light theme
- `ToastContext` - Toast notifications


## Code Standards
- Follow **Prettier** formatting defaults
- Use **ESLint** with recommended TypeScript and React rules
- Prefer **functional components** and **React hooks**
- Use **async/await** over `.then()` syntax
- Avoid magic strings/numbers ‚Äî define constants where applicable
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### React & TypeScript Naming Conventions (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS follow these four critical naming rules:**

1. **Never use snake_case** for variables/functions in React/TypeScript
   - ‚ùå `const user_name = 'john'`
   - ‚úÖ `const userName = 'john'`

2. **Always use camelCase** for variables, functions, props, and object properties
   - ‚úÖ `const isLoggedIn = true`
   - ‚úÖ `function getUserData() {}`
   - ‚úÖ `const [age, setAge] = useState(42)`
   - ‚úÖ `<Button onClick={handleClick} isDisabled={false} />`

3. **PascalCase mandatory** for React components and interfaces (JSX requirement)
   - ‚úÖ `function UserProfile() {}`
   - ‚úÖ `const ProfileCard = () => {}`
   - ‚úÖ `interface UserProps { userName: string; }`

4. **Follow React-specific conventions**:
   - Event handlers: `on` + PascalCase ‚Üí `onClick`, `onUserSelect`
   - State setters: `set` + PascalCase ‚Üí `setAge`, `setUserData`
   - Custom hooks: `use` + PascalCase ‚Üí `useAuth`, `useCustomHook`
   - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` ‚Üí `API_ENDPOINT`, `MAX_RETRIES`

**These rules are non-negotiable and must be followed in all code.**

## Project-Wide Constraints
- No use of paid services during development (must run on free-tier limits)
- Environment secrets must be passed via `.env` files and never hardcoded
- No global state libraries (e.g., Redux) unless scoped locally
- Firebase Security Rules must be enforced for all user data access
- All database changes must be done via Firebase service layer and Firestore

## Project Status

**üéØ CORE FOUNDATION COMPLETE**: Shepherd has been stripped back to focus on core membership management functionality.

**Current Implementation:**
- Member management with full CRUD operations
- Household management with family relationships
- Role-based access control (admin, pastor, member)
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Dashboard views by role
- QR-based member onboarding and magic link authentication

**Features Removed for Reimplementation:**
- Event management and RSVP system
- Donation tracking and financial reports
- Sermon archive and media management
- Volunteer scheduling system

**Current Focus**: Methodical reimplementation of features according to PRD specifications. All development uses Firebase services exclusively.

7. **Development Workflow**: Context7 ‚Üí Serena ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Semgrep ‚Üí Firebase deployment

## PRP Task Format

Each task file follows the **PRP structure**: Purpose, Requirements, Procedure

### Structure:
```md
# <task-name>

## Purpose
<What this task is solving or creating. Plain English, simple.>

## Requirements
- <List of technical or contextual requirements>
- <File or schema dependencies>
- <Firebase, Auth, or other service needed>

## Procedure
<Exact step-by-step instructions that the AI agent should follow. Include file paths, table names, and relevant logic.>
```

### Example:
```md
# create_member_schema

## Purpose
Define the Firestore collection for storing individual member information.

## Requirements
- Collection name: members
- Should link to `households` collection via reference
- Enforce gender as Male/Female only
- Include audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt)

## Procedure
1. Create a new Firestore collection schema for `members`
2. Define `members` document structure with the following fields: ...
3. Apply household reference relationship via `householdId`
4. Add validation rules for gender in Firebase Security Rules
```

## CRITICAL: Information Accuracy Standards

**NEVER provide information unless you are certain it is factually correct based on documented sources.**

### Mandatory Information Verification Protocol:
1. **No Assumptions**: Never assume how third-party services work
2. **No Guessing**: If you don't have documented knowledge, explicitly state "I don't have current documentation on this"
3. **Verify Before Advising**: When providing technical instructions, only give steps you can verify from official documentation
4. **Use Documentation Tools**: Use WebFetch to check official documentation before giving technical advice
5. **Admit Knowledge Gaps**: Always say "I need to check the official documentation" rather than guessing

### Examples of Required Behavior:
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: "You can regenerate Firebase API keys in the console settings"
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: "I need to check Firebase documentation to give you accurate steps for API key management"
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: "This should work based on typical patterns"  
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: "Let me verify this approach against the official documentation first"

### When Uncertain:
1. **State your uncertainty clearly**
2. **Use WebFetch to check official documentation**
3. **Only provide verified, documented procedures**
4. **Never fill gaps with assumptions**

**Providing incorrect information damages trust and can cause security issues. Accuracy is more important than speed.**

## Critical Standards

1. **Data Accuracy**: Member data, donations, and events must be 100% accurate
2. **Security**: Implement proper authentication checks and data validation
3. **Mobile-First**: All features must work on mobile devices
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript strictly - avoid `any` types
5. **Error Handling**: Always provide user-friendly error messages

## **DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY**
**When encountering issues, follow this EXACT order:**

1. **Identify the actual error** - Don't assume root cause from symptoms
2. **Check imports and dependencies** - Circular deps cause "uninitialized variable" errors
3. **Use existing patterns** - Look at working code before creating new solutions  
4. **Test simple fixes first** - Don't overcomplicate 5-minute problems
5. **Understand existing architecture** - Read converter functions, service patterns, etc.
6. **Make minimal changes** - Fix the actual problem, not perceived problems

**RED FLAGS that indicate you're going off the rails:**
- Changing security rules to match code instead of fixing code
- Using different translation systems than what exists
- Making multiple "fixes" for one simple problem
- Not testing simple solutions before complex ones

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create service interface in `src/services/`
2. Implement Firebase service in `src/services/firebase/`
3. Create TypeScript types in `src/types/`
4. Build components in appropriate feature folder
5. Add route if needed in `src/router/`
6. Update relevant context if state management needed

### Working with Forms
- Use React Hook Form for all forms
- Implement proper validation with clear error messages
- Follow existing patterns in `src/components/*/forms/`

### Database Operations
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Implement proper security rules in Firebase Console
- Follow existing patterns for real-time updates using Firestore listeners

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- `VITE_USE_FIREBASE` - Toggle between Supabase and Firebase
- `VITE_FIREBASE_*` - Firebase configuration
- `VITE_SUPABASE_*` - Supabase configuration (legacy)

## Session Management

### Session Startup Protocol
1. **Always read** this CLAUDE.md file first to establish context
2. **Check** `docs/project_tracker.md` for current progress and next tasks
3. **Verify** which phase we're in and any dependencies
4. **Start local development** with `npm run dev` (Firebase runs in cloud)
5. **Confirm** database seeding and authentication working
6. **Review** any session notes from previous work

### Task Execution Order
- **Follow the order** specified in project_tracker.md strictly
- **Verify dependencies** before executing any task
- **Complete each phase** before moving to the next to maintain architectural integrity

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Use exact names** for tables, columns, and routes as specified in task files
- **Reference existing code** when implementing related features
- **Maintain consistency** with previously implemented patterns and components

### Testing Protocol
- **Test incrementally** after creating each schema with a test insert
- **Verify security rules** work correctly before implementing UI components
- **Test each UI component** with different user roles (admin, pastor, member)
- **Confirm integrations** work (e.g., auth triggers, foreign key constraints)

### Error Handling
- **Flag potential issues** proactively during implementation
- **Request clarification** immediately when requirements are ambiguous
- **Document workarounds** if standard approaches don't work
- **Never skip error handling** in production code

### Quality Assurance
- **Follow TypeScript** best practices with proper typing
- **Implement loading states** and error boundaries in React components
- **Ensure mobile responsiveness** using TailwindCSS utilities
- **Apply Firebase Security Rules** consistently across all collections

## Coordination Protocol

If you are unsure of assumptions or hit ambiguous scope:
- Prompt the human architect with exact question
- Halt implementation until confirmed

## Security & Roles System

### Current Role Structure
The application uses three primary roles stored on Member documents:
- **`admin`** - Full system administrator
- **`pastor`** - Church leadership with pastoral care access
- **`member`** - Regular church member with limited access

### Critical Security Requirements

#### Member Role Access (Principle of Least Privilege)
**Members should ONLY see:**
- ‚úÖ Own profile and household information
- ‚úÖ Own donation history only
- ‚úÖ Upcoming public events (not private/admin events)
- ‚úÖ Limited church directory (names, public contact info only)
- ‚úÖ Own event RSVPs and attendance
- ‚ùå **NEVER** other members' donations or financial details
- ‚ùå **NEVER** private member information or pastoral notes
- ‚ùå **NEVER** administrative functions or reports

#### Pastor Role Access (Pastoral Care Focus)
**Pastors should have access to:**
- ‚úÖ All member information for pastoral care purposes
- ‚úÖ Event creation and management (all events)
- ‚úÖ Aggregate donation reports (not individual line items unless pastoral need)
- ‚úÖ Full church directory and member engagement analytics
- ‚úÖ Event attendance tracking across all events
- ‚ùå System administration functions
- ‚ùå User role assignments
- ‚ùå Individual donation details without specific justification

#### Admin Role Access (Full System Access)
**Admins have complete access to:**
- ‚úÖ All financial data and detailed reports
- ‚úÖ User role management and system configuration
- ‚úÖ All analytics, reporting, and data export/import
- ‚úÖ Audit logs and system monitoring
- ‚úÖ Database administration functions

### Implementation Priorities

#### Phase 1 (Critical Security)
1. **Dashboard filtering** - Implement role-based data filtering on all dashboard views
2. **Financial data security** - Ensure members only see own donations
3. **Role assignment system** - Admin-only interface for managing roles
4. **Audit logging** - Track all role changes and sensitive data access

#### Phase 2 (Enhanced Permissions)
1. **Granular permissions system** - Permission-based access beyond just roles
2. **Additional roles** - Treasurer, volunteer coordinator, ministry leader
3. **Role expiration** - Time-limited role assignments
4. **Approval workflows** - Multi-step approval for sensitive access

### Database Schema Requirements

#### Enhanced Role Assignment (Future)
```typescript
interface RoleAssignment {
  id: string
  memberId: string
  role: string
  permissions: Permission[]
  assignedBy: string
  assignedAt: Timestamp
  expiresAt?: Timestamp
  isActive: boolean
}

interface AuditLog {
  id: string
  action: 'role_assigned' | 'role_removed' | 'permission_granted'
  performedBy: string
  affectedMember: string
  details: any
  timestamp: Timestamp
}
```

### Security Best Practices
1. **Principle of least privilege** - Default to minimal access
2. **Data segregation** - Financial and personal data have strict access controls
3. **Audit trail** - All role changes and sensitive data access logged
4. **Session management** - Role changes require re-authentication
5. **Regular audits** - Quarterly review of role assignments

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing any dashboard or data access feature, always consider what role should see what data. Default to restricting access rather than allowing it.
