## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Service Layer Architecture
The codebase uses a Firebase-based service layer pattern:
- `src/services/firebase/` - Firebase service implementations
- Core services: members, households, events, roles
- All services extend BaseFirestoreService for consistent patterns

### **CRITICAL: Data Translation & Type Conversion**
**ALWAYS use the existing translation system - DO NOT create new ones!**

- **`src/utils/firestore-converters.ts`** - The ONLY translation layer between TypeScript and Firestore
- Contains `memberToMemberDocument()` and `memberDocumentToMember()` converters
- **TypeScript uses camelCase, Firestore ALSO uses camelCase** (via converters)
- **DO NOT use `firestore-field-mapper.ts`** - this is for different use cases
- **Firebase Security Rules expect camelCase** (firstName, lastName, memberStatus)

**Before changing ANY data layer code:**
1. Check existing converter functions first
2. Understand what translation system is already in place
3. Never assume field naming conventions without checking the converters

### Component Organization
Components are organized by feature in `src/components/`:
- `members/` - Member management components
- `households/` - Household management components
- `auth/` - Authentication and role guards
- `admin/` - Administrative functions (role management)
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard views by role
- `common/` - Shared UI components
- Page-level components in `src/pages/`

### Type Definitions
All TypeScript types are centralized in `src/types/`:
- `index.ts` - Core domain models (Member, Household)
- `events.ts` - Event system types (Event, EventRSVP, EventAttendance)
- `firestore.ts` - Firebase/Firestore schema types
- Clean, Firebase-focused type definitions

### Data Management Patterns
- **Firestore Converters**: `src/utils/firestore-converters.ts` - Type-safe Firestore document conversion
- **Service Layer**: Firebase services with consistent CRUD patterns
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners for live data synchronization
- **Role-based Data Access**: Security enforced at service layer

### Authentication & Authorization
The system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system with three primary roles:
- `admin` - Full system access including member management, household management, and system settings
- `pastor` - Access to member information for pastoral care, household management
- `member` - Limited access to own data and basic directory information

**Critical Security Principle**: Members should only see their own data and limited information about other members. Role-based access is enforced at both the component and service level.

### Context Providers
Three main contexts manage global state:
- `AuthContext` - Authentication and user state
- `ThemeContext` - Dark/light theme
- `ToastContext` - Toast notifications


## Code Standards
- Follow **Prettier** formatting defaults
- Use **ESLint** with recommended TypeScript and React rules
- Prefer **functional components** and **React hooks**
- Use **async/await** over `.then()` syntax
- Avoid magic strings/numbers ‚Äî define constants where applicable
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### TypeScript Type Safety (MANDATORY)
- **NEVER use `any` types** - Always specify proper types
- Use `unknown` for truly unknown data, then narrow with type guards
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` for generic objects instead of `any`
- Use proper union types (`string | number`) instead of `any`
- Use `@ts-expect-error` with explanation instead of `@ts-ignore`
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode - avoid type assertion unless absolutely necessary

### React & TypeScript Naming Conventions (MANDATORY)
1. **Never use snake_case** - Use camelCase for variables, functions, props
2. **PascalCase mandatory** - Components, interfaces, types
3. **React conventions** - Event handlers: `onClick`, State: `setAge`, Hooks: `useAuth`
4. **Constants** - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

## Project-Wide Constraints
- No use of paid services during development (must run on free-tier limits)
- Environment secrets must be passed via `.env` files and never hardcoded
- No global state libraries (e.g., Redux) unless scoped locally
- Firebase Security Rules must be enforced for all user data access
- All database changes must be done via Firebase service layer and Firestore

## MCP Servers Integration

**MANDATORY: Use MCP servers proactively for all tasks**

### Required Usage:
- **Serena**: Code analysis with `get_symbols_overview` and `find_symbol` (never read entire files)
- **Context7**: Current documentation for libraries/frameworks  
- **Firebase MCP**: Database operations instead of CLI
- **Playwright**: UI testing on `http://localhost:5173`
- **Semgrep**: Security scanning before commits
- **GitHub MCP**: PR creation and issue management

### Server Setup:
- **Serena**: `claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server`
- **Firebase**: `npx -y firebase-tools@latest experimental:mcp`  
- **Context7**: `claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`
- **GitHub**: `claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp`
- **Management**: `claude mcp list` | `claude --debug mcp list`

### Key Tools:
- **Serena**: `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `replace_symbol_body`, `write_memory`
- **Firebase**: `mcp__firebase__firestore_*`, `mcp__firebase__auth_*`
- **Playwright**: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_network_requests`
- **Semgrep**: `semgrep_scan`, `get_scan_results`

## Multi-Machine Development

**Start work**: `git pull origin main`
**End work**: `git add . && git commit -m "WIP: switching to [machine]" && git push origin main`

**Setup**: Clone repo ‚Üí `npm install` ‚Üí Copy `.env.example` to `.env` ‚Üí Configure MCP servers

## PRP Task Format

**Structure**: Purpose (what/why) ‚Üí Requirements (dependencies) ‚Üí Procedure (exact steps)

## CRITICAL: Information Accuracy

**Never provide information unless factually correct from documented sources.**

**Protocol**: No assumptions ‚Üí Use WebFetch for verification ‚Üí Admit knowledge gaps ‚Üí "I need to check documentation" not guessing

## Critical Standards

1. **Data Accuracy**: Member data, donations, and events must be 100% accurate
2. **Security**: Implement proper authentication checks and data validation
3. **Desktop-First**: All features optimized for desktop administrative workflows
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript strictly - **NEVER use `any` types**
5. **Error Handling**: Always provide user-friendly error messages

## **DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY**
1. **Identify actual error** - Don't assume from symptoms
2. **Check imports/dependencies** - Circular deps cause "uninitialized variable" errors  
3. **Use existing patterns** - Look at working code first
4. **Test simple fixes** - Don't overcomplicate
5. **Understand architecture** - Read converters, service patterns
6. **Make minimal changes** - Fix actual problem only

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create service interface in `src/services/`
2. Implement Firebase service in `src/services/firebase/`
3. Create TypeScript types in `src/types/`
4. Build components in appropriate feature folder
5. Add route if needed in `src/router/`
6. Update relevant context if state management needed

### Working with Forms
- Use React Hook Form for all forms
- Implement proper validation with clear error messages
- Follow existing patterns in `src/components/*/forms/`

### Database Operations
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Implement proper security rules in Firebase Console
- Follow existing patterns for real-time updates using Firestore listeners

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- `VITE_USE_FIREBASE` - Toggle between Supabase and Firebase
- `VITE_FIREBASE_*` - Firebase configuration
- `VITE_SUPABASE_*` - Supabase configuration (legacy)

## Session Management

### Session Startup Protocol
1. **Always read** this CLAUDE.md file first to establish context
2. **Check** `docs/project_tracker.md` for current progress and next tasks
3. **Verify** which phase we're in and any dependencies
4. **Start local development** with `npm run dev` (Firebase runs in cloud)
5. **Confirm** database seeding and authentication working
6. **Review** any session notes from previous work

### Task Execution Order
- **Follow the order** specified in project_tracker.md strictly
- **Verify dependencies** before executing any task
- **Complete each phase** before moving to the next to maintain architectural integrity

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Use exact names** for tables, columns, and routes as specified in task files
- **Reference existing code** when implementing related features
- **Maintain consistency** with previously implemented patterns and components

### Testing Protocol
- **Test incrementally** after creating each schema with a test insert
- **Verify security rules** work correctly before implementing UI components
- **Test each UI component** with different user roles (admin, pastor, member)
- **Confirm integrations** work (e.g., auth triggers, foreign key constraints)

### Error Handling
- **Flag potential issues** proactively during implementation
- **Request clarification** immediately when requirements are ambiguous
- **Document workarounds** if standard approaches don't work
- **Never skip error handling** in production code

### Quality Assurance
- **Follow TypeScript** best practices with proper typing
- **Implement loading states** and error boundaries in React components
- **Ensure desktop efficiency** using TailwindCSS utilities for administrative workflows
- **Apply Firebase Security Rules** consistently across all collections

## Coordination Protocol

If you are unsure of assumptions or hit ambiguous scope:
- Prompt the human architect with exact question
- Halt implementation until confirmed

## Security & Roles System

### Current Role Structure
The application uses three primary roles stored on Member documents:
- **`admin`** - Full system administrator
- **`pastor`** - Church leadership with pastoral care access
- **`member`** - Regular church member with limited access

### Critical Security Requirements

#### Member Role Access (Principle of Least Privilege)
**Members should ONLY see:**
- ‚úÖ Own profile and household information
- ‚úÖ Own donation history only
- ‚úÖ Upcoming public events (not private/admin events)
- ‚úÖ Limited church directory (names, public contact info only)
- ‚úÖ Own event RSVPs and attendance
- ‚ùå **NEVER** other members' donations or financial details
- ‚ùå **NEVER** private member information or pastoral notes
- ‚ùå **NEVER** administrative functions or reports

#### Pastor Role Access (Pastoral Care Focus)
**Pastors should have access to:**
- ‚úÖ All member information for pastoral care purposes
- ‚úÖ Event creation and management (all events)
- ‚úÖ Aggregate donation reports (not individual line items unless pastoral need)
- ‚úÖ Full church directory and member engagement analytics
- ‚úÖ Event attendance tracking across all events
- ‚ùå System administration functions
- ‚ùå User role assignments
- ‚ùå Individual donation details without specific justification

#### Admin Role Access (Full System Access)
**Admins have complete access to:**
- ‚úÖ All financial data and detailed reports
- ‚úÖ User role management and system configuration
- ‚úÖ All analytics, reporting, and data export/import
- ‚úÖ Audit logs and system monitoring
- ‚úÖ Database administration functions

### Implementation Priorities

#### Phase 1 (Critical Security)
1. **Dashboard filtering** - Implement role-based data filtering on all dashboard views
2. **Financial data security** - Ensure members only see own donations
3. **Role assignment system** - Admin-only interface for managing roles
4. **Audit logging** - Track all role changes and sensitive data access

#### Phase 2 (Enhanced Permissions)
1. **Granular permissions system** - Permission-based access beyond just roles
2. **Additional roles** - Treasurer, volunteer coordinator, ministry leader
3. **Role expiration** - Time-limited role assignments
4. **Approval workflows** - Multi-step approval for sensitive access

**CRITICAL**: Default to restricting access. Members only see own data, pastors see member info for care, admins see everything.


## Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL: Use environment date as authoritative source for "today's date" - never use existing doc dates**

**Documentation Hierarchy**: CLAUDE.md (this file) ‚Üí docs/INDEX.md ‚Üí README.md ‚Üí docs/*

**Key Requirements**: 
- Update docs with feature changes
- Include update timestamps  
- Archive obsolete content to docs/archive/
- Maintain accuracy - never contradict implementation
