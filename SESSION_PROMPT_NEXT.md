**Current Status:** Phase 2B Event Calendar & Attendance System - 70% Complete (7 of 10 PRPs)

## Next Priority: PRP-2B-008 Event Details & RSVP Modal

**Implementation Goal:** Create interactive event details modal with comprehensive RSVP management and user-friendly event interaction.

**Session Objectives:**
1. Create EventDetailsModal component for comprehensive event display
2. Implement RSVP management interface with status changes and guest counts
3. Add event sharing and calendar export functionality  
4. Create responsive modal design with proper accessibility
5. Integrate with existing RSVP service and real-time updates
6. Add role-based management actions (edit/delete for admin/pastor)
7. Implement proper modal state management and navigation
8. Test modal interactions with different user roles and event types

## Key Context Files

**Recently Modified (This Session):**
- `src/pages/Events.tsx` - Event listing implementation patterns to follow
- `src/components/events/EventCard.tsx` - Event display patterns and RSVP integration
- `src/components/events/EventFilters.tsx` - Filtering system patterns
- `src/router/index.tsx` - Routing integration patterns
- `src/components/common/Navigation.tsx` - Navigation integration patterns

**Foundation Services (Ready):**
- `src/services/firebase/events.service.ts` - Complete events CRUD with role-based queries
- `src/services/firebase/event-rsvp.service.ts` - RSVP management with capacity/waitlist
- `src/types/events.ts` - Complete Event/RSVP type definitions
- `firestore.rules` - Role-based security rules deployed

**Documentation:**
- `docs/prps/phase-2b-events/PRP-2B-007-calendar-view.md` - Detailed specification
- `docs/project_tracker.md` - Updated with PRP-2B-006 completion
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project patterns and standards

## Implementation Strategy

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Complexity:** Moderate-High (calendar grid logic, date calculations, responsive design)

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Calendar Grid Component:** Month/week view with proper date navigation
2. **Event Integration:** Display events in calendar cells with visual indicators
3. **Interactive Features:** Click-to-create events, event tooltips/popovers
4. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly calendar interface
5. **Filtering:** Calendar-specific filters (month/week view, event types)
6. **RSVP Integration:** Show user RSVP status on calendar events
7. **Role-Based Features:** Admin/pastor event management from calendar

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use date-fns or similar for date calculations and formatting
- Follow established component patterns from EventCard/EventFilters
- Ensure proper handling of multi-day and all-day events
- Implement proper loading states for calendar navigation
- Handle edge cases (month boundaries, leap years, etc.)

## Session Startup Protocol

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** to establish project context and patterns
2. **Review docs/project_tracker.md** to confirm current progress
3. **Read PRP-2B-007 specification** for detailed requirements  
4. **Examine existing Event components** to understand patterns
5. **Start `npm run dev`** for development testing
6. **Begin implementation** following established patterns

## Expected Deliverables

- Main Calendar page component with month/week views
- Interactive calendar grid with event visualization
- Calendar-specific filtering and navigation controls
- Integration with existing events service and RSVP system
- Role-based calendar features for different user types
- Routing and navigation integration
- Testing verification across user roles and viewport sizes

## Success Metrics

- Calendar displays events correctly in month/week views
- Event creation from calendar works properly
- RSVP integration shows user status on calendar events
- Calendar navigation (prev/next month) functions correctly
- Mobile-responsive calendar interface works well
- Role-based features display appropriately
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors

## Post-Implementation

After completing PRP-2B-007:
- **Next:** PRP-2B-008 Event Details & RSVP Modal
- **Progress:** Phase 2B will be 70% complete (7 of 10 PRPs)
- **Update:** Project tracker and commit changes
- **MVP Status:** ~61% complete overall
