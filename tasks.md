> Issue: "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in RSVPModal/EventCard components

## Overview

Critical bug fix needed for infinite re-render loops in RSVP modal functionality. The issue manifests as "Maximum update depth exceeded" React errors, indicating state updates triggering unnecessary re-renders in a loop.

## Task 1: Root Cause Analysis & Diagnosis

**Objective**: Identify the exact source of the infinite re-render loop in RSVPModal/EventCard components.

### Subtasks:
1. **Analyze current component state flow**
   - Map out all state variables in RSVPModal and EventCard components
   - Document all useEffect dependencies and triggers
   - Identify any direct state mutations or circular dependencies

2. **Review event handlers and callbacks**
   - Audit onClick, onChange, and other event handlers for inline function definitions
   - Check for callback props being recreated on every render
   - Verify proper memoization of callback functions

3. **Examine service layer interactions**
   - Review RSVP service calls and their return values
   - Check for unnecessary service calls triggering state updates
   - Verify proper error handling that doesn't cause re-render loops

4. **Create minimal reproduction case**
   - Build isolated test component demonstrating the loop
   - Document exact steps to trigger the maximum update depth error
   - Capture React DevTools profiler data showing the loop pattern

## Task 2: State Management Architecture Fix

**Objective**: Restructure component state management to eliminate circular dependencies and unnecessary re-renders.

### Subtasks:
1. **Implement proper useCallback and useMemo patterns**
   - Wrap all callback functions in useCallback with correct dependencies
   - Memoize complex computed values with useMemo
   - Ensure dependency arrays are complete and accurate

2. **Optimize useEffect dependencies**
   - Review all useEffect hooks for missing or incorrect dependencies
   - Split complex useEffect hooks into focused, single-purpose effects
   - Add proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

3. **Refactor state structure**
   - Consolidate related state variables into single objects where appropriate
   - Eliminate redundant state that can be derived from other state
   - Implement proper state initialization patterns

4. **Add React.memo optimizations**
   - Wrap child components in React.memo where appropriate
   - Create proper comparison functions for complex props
   - Ensure parent components don't unnecessarily re-render children

## Task 3: Component Integration Testing

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing to verify the state loop fix works across all RSVP modal scenarios.

### Subtasks:
1. **Create unit tests for isolated components**
   - Test RSVPModal component with various props and state combinations
   - Test EventCard component RSVP interactions
   - Mock all service dependencies to isolate component behavior

2. **Integration tests for modal workflows**
   - Test complete RSVP submission flow from EventCard to modal close
   - Test modal opening/closing with different event states
   - Verify proper cleanup when modal is unmounted

3. **Error boundary and edge case testing**
   - Test behavior when RSVP service calls fail
   - Test rapid user interactions (double-clicks, quick modal toggles)
   - Verify graceful handling of invalid event data

4. **Performance testing with React Profiler**
   - Measure render counts before and after fixes
   - Verify no excessive re-renders during normal user interactions
   - Document performance improvements in render cycle efficiency

## Task 4: Service Layer Optimization

**Objective**: Ensure RSVP service interactions don't contribute to the re-render loop issue.

### Subtasks:
1. **Audit RSVP service call patterns**
   - Review when and how often RSVP services are called
   - Identify any service calls happening on every render
   - Implement proper service call debouncing/throttling if needed

2. **Optimize service response handling**
   - Ensure service responses don't trigger unnecessary state updates
   - Implement proper loading states that don't cause render loops
   - Add response caching where appropriate to reduce redundant calls

3. **Error handling improvements**
   - Implement proper error boundaries for service failures
   - Ensure error states don't trigger re-render loops
   - Add user-friendly error messages without state side effects

4. **Service layer testing**
   - Mock service responses to test component behavior
   - Test service failure scenarios and recovery
   - Verify service calls are properly cancelled when components unmount

## Task 5: Code Quality & Documentation

**Objective**: Improve code maintainability and prevent future state management issues.

### Subtasks:
1. **Code review and cleanup**
   - Remove any unused state variables or effects
   - Ensure consistent coding patterns across RSVP components
   - Add proper TypeScript types for all state and props

2. **Add comprehensive documentation**
   - Document state flow and component interactions
   - Add inline comments explaining complex useEffect dependencies
   - Create architectural decision records for state management patterns

3. **Implement development safeguards**
   - Add ESLint rules to catch common re-render patterns
   - Create custom hooks for complex state logic to improve reusability
   - Add React DevTools annotations for better debugging

4. **Create troubleshooting guide**
   - Document common React state management pitfalls
   - Create debugging checklist for future state loop issues
   - Add monitoring/logging for production state management issues
